1. Open "extract_words.py" with an IDE of your choosing and run it (this step is needed if allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt, and wordfrequency.txt is not present in the directory).
2. Place "uniquewords.txt" from the main directory into the folder "a3_novelvisualization".
3. Place "wordfreqeuency.txt" from the main directory into the folder "a3_wordfrequency".
4. Open "a3_novelvisualization.pde" in the "a3_novelvisualization" folder, running it in Processing to generate a wordcloud of unique words.
5. Open "a3_wordfrequency.pde" in the "a3_a3_wordfrequency" folder, running it in Processing to generate an interactive frequency chart of the number of words present in the original text.
6. Open "the_days_play.png" in the main directory for a pregenerated wordcloud of all the words in the original text.
