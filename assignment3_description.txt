Our project begins with a python file that takes in the book "The Days we Play" and subsequently creates the textfiles allwords.txt by finding the word in a slew of characters and lowercasing it, which creates a file with duplicate words.

From there, we have done the same for uniquewords and wordfequency.txt to display unique words from the novel in a visual format based on allwords.txt, in which the words are color coded.

We then picked the font of Times New Roman, which created the space and with a font of 28. Then, we created a word chart with color coded of green, red and blue to produce this. The canvas can be refreshed with new words.

From there, we created a bar chart visualization through a loop that separated the wordfrequency text into the number and how frequent it appeared meme, looping through to produce a color coded bar chart with a mouse pointer that allows us to see the frequency over 4 distinct ranges.

Other features include a randomized word feature approach with a new pattern each time the canvas is refreshed, and a gradient color scheme between red and green. The software relied upon was Processing 3.x for visualization, with no unresolved issues. 

Nhan did the python file and wordcloud png, Noah did the novel visualization with the READme, and Sai did the wordfrequency file along with writing the report. Noah helped with both the pythonfile regex and the wordfrequency file (to add the color and mouse point).
