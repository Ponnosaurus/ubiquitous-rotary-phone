the
rabbits
part
chapter
introducing
the
lop-eared
ones
and
others
by
hobbs
cried
archie
as
he
began
to
put
away
the
porridge
feel
as
fit
as
anything
this
morning
i'm
absolutely
safe
for
century
you
shouldn't
boast
with
your
mouth
full
myra
told
her
brother
it
wasn't
quite
full
pleaded
archie
and
really
am
good
for
runs
to-day
you
will
make
said
exactly
fourteen
hallo
good-morning
didn't
see
you
were
there
have
been
here
all
the
time
fourteen
it
seems
lot
said
myra
doubtfully
archie
laughed
in
scorn
the
incoming
batsman
began
who
seemed
in
no
way
daunted
by
the
position
of
affairs
five
hundred
for
nine
put
in
myra
reached
double
figures
for
the
fourth
time
this
season
with
lofty
snick
to
the
boundary
then
turning
his
attention
to
the
slow
bowler
he
despatched
him
between
his
pads
and
the
wicket
for
couple
this
however
was
his
last
scoring
stroke
as
in
the
same
over
he
played
forward
to
long
hop
and
fell
victim
to
the
vigilance
of
the
wicket-keeper
for
nearly
quarter
of
an
hour
continued
myra
he
had
defied
the
attack
and
the
character
of
his
batting
may
be
easily
judged
from
the
fact
that
his
score
included
one
five
four
from
an
overthrow
added
in
parenthesis
and
one
four
save
for
chance
to
mid-on
before
he
had
scored
and
another
in
the
slips
when
seven
his
innings
was
almost
entirely
free
from
blemish
although
on
one
occasion
he
had
the
good
fortune
when
playing
back
to
half-volley
to
strike
the
wicket
without
dislodging
the
bails
see
to-morrow's
sportsman
concluded
myra
oh
you
children
laughed
archie
as
he
walked
over
to
inspect
the
ham
bless
you
miss
fortescue
gave
little
cough
and
began
to
speak
miss
fortescue
is
one
of
those
thoroughly
good
girls
who
take
an
interest
in
everything
genuine
trier
on
this
occasion
she
said
often
wonder
who
it
is
who
writes
those
accounts
in
the
sportsman
it
is
believed
to
be
mr
simpson
said
archie
simpson
looked
up
with
start
and
jerked
his
glasses
into
his
tea
he
fished
them
out
and
wiped
them
thoughtfully
the
credible
he
began
is
rarely
gentlemen
pray
you
silence
for
mr
simpson's
epigram
cried
archie
oh
always
thought
mr
simpson
wrote
verses
in
the
saturday
review
said
miss
fortescue
in
the
silence
which
followed
as
relaxation
only
explained
the
other
is
his
life-work
we
read
him
with
great
interest
that
bit
about
the
heavy
roller
being
requisitioned
is
my
favourite
line
mr
simpson
and
killick
and
crawford
all
play
in
glasses
put
in
myra
eagerly
across
the
table
that
is
their
only
point
in
common
added
archie
oh
isn't
he
very
good
player
well
he's
thoroughly
honest
and
punctual
and
sober
player
said
but
the
fact
is
he
and
and
the
major
don't
make
many
runs
nowadays
we
generally
give
as
he
has
said
in
one
of
his
less
popular
poems
local
habitation
to
the
er
airy
nothing
thought
it
was
shakespeare
said
that
shakespeare
or
simpson
hallo
there's
thomas
at
last
thomas
is
in
the
admiralty
which
is
why
he
is
always
late
it
is
great
pity
that
he
was
christened
thomas
he
can
never
rise
to
the
top
of
his
profession
with
name
like
that
you
couldn't
imagine
thomas
mckenna
or
even
thomas
nelson
but
he
doesn't
seem
to
mind
somehow
morning
everybody
said
thomas
isn't
it
beastly
day
we'll
hoist
the
south
cone
for
you
said
archie
and
he
balanced
mushroom
upside
down
on
the
end
of
his
fork
what's
the
matter
with
the
day
asked
our
host
the
major
still
intent
on
his
paper
it's
so
early
when
was
boy
my
father
major
mannering
said
archie
will
now
relate
an
anecdote
of
waterloo
but
the
major
was
deep
in
his
paper
suddenly
he
there
is
only
one
word
for
it
snorted
the
budget
said
myra
and
archie
exchanging
anxious
glances
ha
that's
good
he
said
that's
very
good
if
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
imagines
that
he
can
make
his
iniquitous
budget
more
acceptable
to
disgusted
public
by
treating
it
in
spirit
of
airy
persiflage
he
is
at
liberty
to
try
but
airy
persiflage
when
brought
into
contact
with
the
determined
temper
of
nation
who
is
the
hairy
percy
anyhow
said
thomas
to
himself
the
major
glared
at
the
interrupter
for
moment
then
for
he
knows
his
weakness
and
is
particularly
fond
of
thomas
he
threw
his
paper
down
and
laughed
well
he
said
are
we
going
to
win
to-day
and
while
he
and
archie
talked
about
the
wicket
his
daughter
removed
the
times
to
safe
distance
but
there
aren't
eleven
of
you
here
said
miss
fortescue
to
me
and
if
you
and
mr
simpson
and
major
mannering
aren't
very
good
you'll
be
beaten
it's
against
the
village
the
first
two
days
isn't
it
when
said
we
weren't
very
good
only
meant
we
didn't
make
many
runs
mr
simpson
is
noted
fast
bowler
the
major
has
scarf
which
can
be
seen
quite
easily
at
point
and
keep
wicket
between
us
we
dismiss
many
professor
just
as
they
are
shaping
for
cut
you
know
they
catch
sight
of
the
major's
scarf
lose
their
heads
and
give
me
an
easy
catch
then
archie
and
thomas
take
centuries
one
of
the
gardeners
bends
them
from
the
off
and
makes
them
swim
bit
the
vicar
of
his
plenty
is
lending
us
two
sons
tony
and
dahlia
blair
come
down
this
morning
and
there
is
chauffeur
who
plays
for
keeps
how
many
is
that
eleven
isn't
it
it
ought
only
to
be
ten
said
myra
who
had
overheard
oh
yes
was
counting
miss
blair
said
miss
fortescue
we
never
play
more
than
ten
side
said
archie
oh
why
so
as
to
give
the
scorer
an
extra
line
or
two
for
the
byes
myra
laughed
then
catching
my
eye
looked
preternaturally
solemn
if
you've
quite
finished
breakfast
mr
gaukrodger
she
said
there'll
be
just
time
for
me
to
beat
you
at
croquet
before
the
rabbits
take
the
field
right
said
of
course
you
know
my
name
isn't
really
gaukrodger
chapter
ii
on
the
run
the
major
has
taken
great
deal
of
trouble
with
his
ground
and
the
result
pleases
everybody
if
you
are
batsman
you
applaud
the
short
boundaries
if
you
are
wicket-keeper
as
am
and
thomas
is
bowling
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
googlies
you
have
leisure
to
study
some
delightful
scenery
and
if
you
are
left-handed
bowler
with
delivery
outside
the
screen
there
is
behind
you
belt
of
trees
which
you
cannot
fail
to
admire
when
archie
was
born
and
they
announced
the
fact
to
the
major
his
first
question
was
so
understand
right
or
left
handed
they
told
him
left
to
quiet
him
and
he
went
out
and
planted
small
forest
so
that
it
should
be
ready
for
archibald's
action
when
he
grew
up
unfortunately
archie
turned
out
to
be
no
bowler
at
all
in
my
opinion
and
right-handed
at
that
nemesis
as
the
ha'penny
papers
say
well
we
all
asked
when
archie
came
back
from
tossing
they
lost
and
put
us
in
good
man
may
have
my
sixpence
back
said
you
haven't
bent
it
or
anything
have
you
thanks
as
the
whole
pavilion
seemed
to
be
full
of
people
putting
on
their
pads
in
order
to
go
in
first
wandered
outside
there
met
myra
hallo
we're
in
said
come
and
sit
on
the
roller
with
me
and
i'll
tell
you
all
about
jayes
can't
for
moment
do
go
and
make
yourself
pleasant
to
dahlia
blair
she's
just
come
do
you
think
she'd
be
interested
in
jayes
mean
the
leicestershire
cricketer
not
the
disinfectant
oh
all
right
then
won't
wandered
over
to
the
deck-chairs
and
exchanged
greetings
with
miss
blair
have
been
asked
to
make
myself
pleasant
said
suppose
that
means
telling
you
all
about
everybody
doesn't
it
yes
please
well
we're
in
as
you
see
that's
the
vicar
leading
his
team
out
he's
no
player
really
one
of
the
among
others
we
noticed
but
he's
good
father
and
we've
borrowed
two
offsprings
from
him
here
comes
archie
and
wilks
wilks
drove
you
from
the
station
expect
he
did
and
very
furiously
well
he
hardly
drives
at
all
when
he's
in
he's
terribly
slow
what
they
call
nature's
reaction
archie
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
has
just
distinguished
himself
by
putting
me
in
last
he
called
it
ninth
wicket
down
but
worked
it
out
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anybody
after
me
it's
simply
spite
hope
mr
archie
makes
some
runs
said
dahlia
don't
mind
so
much
about
wilks
you
know
i'm
afraid
he
is
only
going
to
make
fourteen
to-day
that's
the
postman
going
to
bowl
to
him
he
has
two
deliveries
one
at
eight
and
one
at
twelve-thirty
the
second
one
is
rather
doubtful
archie
always
takes
guard
with
the
bail
you
observe
and
then
looks
round
to
see
if
we're
all
watching
don't
be
so
unkind
i'm
annoyed
said
and
intensely
dislike
the
name
archibald
ninth
wicket
down
the
umpire
having
called
play
joe
the
postman
bounded
up
to
the
wicket
and
delivered
the
ball
archie
played
forward
with
the
easy
confidence
of
school
professional
when
nobody
is
bowling
to
him
and
then
the
leg-bail
disappeared
oh
cried
dahlia
he's
out
looked
at
her
and
looked
at
archie's
disconsolate
back
as
he
made
for
the
pavilion
and
knew
what
he
would
want
got
up
must
go
now
said
i've
promised
to
sit
on
the
heavy
roller
for
bit
archie
will
be
here
in
moment
will
you
tell
him
from
me
that
we
both
thought
he
wasn't
quite
ready
for
that
one
and
that
it
never
rose
an
inch
thank
you
very
much
discovered
myra
and
we
sat
on
the
roller
together
well
i've
been
making
myself
pleasant
said
and
then
when
archie
got
out
knew
he'd
want
to
sit
next
to
her
so
came
away
that
is
what
they
call
tact
in
the
lady
archie
is
rather
fond
of
her
said
myra
don't
know
if
yes
yes
understand
years
ago
let's
see
are
you
ninety
or
ninety-one
always
forget
ninety-one
next
st
crispin's
day
i'm
sorry
archie's
out
the
popular
cricketer
was
unfortunate
enough
to
meet
trimmer
first
ball
and
the
silent
sympathy
of
the
bank
holiday
crowd
went
out
to
him
as
he
wended
his
way
to
the
pavilion
extract
from
pavilions
have
wended
to
by
percy
benskin
help
there
goes
blair
after
this
the
situation
became
very
serious
in
an
hour
seven
of
us
had
got
what
might
call
the
postman's
knock
wilks
was
still
in
but
he
had
only
made
nine
the
score
was
fifty-two
thanks
entirely
to
simpson
who
had
got
thirty-five
between
first
and
second
slip
in
twenty
minutes
this
stroke
of
his
is
known
as
the
simpson
upper
cut
and
is
delivered
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
off
the
edge
of
the
bat
this
is
awful
said
myra
you'll
simply
have
to
make
some
now
think
it's
time
wilks
got
on
to
his
second
speed
why
doesn't
somebody
tell
him
hallo
there
goes
john
knew
there
wasn't
run
there
where
are
my
gloves
you
mustn't
be
nervous
oh
do
make
some
the
condemned
man
walked
firmly
to
the
wickets
what
is
that
umpire
he
asked
in
his
usual
cool
voice
houtside
the
leg
stump
sir
said
the
man
in
white
good
he
replied
what
an
ass
your
second
gardener
is
fancy
being
potted
out
like
that
just
as
if
he
were
geranium
ought
to
wear
cap
oughtn't
in
case
want
to
bow
when
come
in
good-bye
shall
be
back
for
lunch
expect
passed
joe
on
my
way
to
the
wickets
and
asked
pleasantly
after
his
wife
and
family
he
was
rather
brusque
about
it
and
sent
down
very
fast
half-volley
which
kept
low
then
wilks
and
returned
to
the
pavilion
together
amid
cheers
on
the
whole
the
rabbits
had
lived
up
to
their
reputation
well
we
are
lot
of
bunnies
said
archie
at
lunch
joe
simply
stands
there
looking
like
lettuce
and
out
we
all
trot
we
shall
have
to
take
to
halma
or
something
simpson
you
swim
don't
you
you
don't
have
to
swim
at
halma
said
simpson
anyhow
said
blair
we
can't
blame
the
selection
committee
blame
thomas
said
he
would
have
eight
and
he
wouldn't
wait
don't
blame
myself
because
my
average
is
now
three
spot
five
and
yesterday
it
was
only
three
spot
one
that
is
impossible
if
you
made
nought
to-day
said
simpson
eagerly
not
if
divided
it
wrong
yesterday
averages
said
the
major
to
the
vicar
catching
the
last
sentence
but
two
are
the
curse
of
modern
cricket
when
was
boy
this
archie
explained
to
us
takes
us
back
to
the
thirties
when
felix
mynn
bowled
ensign
mannering
with
full
pilch
dear
old
fuller
pilch
ah
what
do
they
know
of
england
who
only
king
and
jayes
declaimed
libretto
by
simpson
who's
finished
said
archie
getting
up
come
out
and
smoke
now
we
simply
must
buck
up
and
out
the
opposition
simpson
ought
to
bump
them
at
joe's
end
and
thomas
always
swerve
after
lunch
said
thomas
don't
wonder
what
was
going
to
say
was
that
you
would
box
them
in
the
slips
you
know
if
we
all
buck
up
we
bucked
up
and
outed
them
by
the
end
of
the
day
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
chapter
iii
good
shooting
will
somebody
give
me
cigarette
said
myra
stretching
out
hand
fancy
not
said
thomas
and
both
feel
that
you
are
too
young
don't
really
want
one
but
when
i'm
locked
up
in
the
billiard-room
with
two
dumb
men
we
were
reflecting
on
our
blessed
victory
were
you
thinking
of
archie's
century
or
john's
bowling
neither
oddly
enough
was
recalling
my
own
catch
which
won
the
match
poetry
let's
go
and
tell
simpson
it
was
skier
said
myra
thought
it
was
never
coming
down
what
did
you
think
of
all
the
time
everything
all
my
past
life
flashed
before
my
eyes
saw
again
my
happy
childhood's
days
when
played
innocently
in
the
er
pantry
saw
myself
at
school
sl
working
saw
did
you
happen
interrupted
thomas
when
we
both
thought
he
was
fast
asleep
to
see
yourself
being
badly
taken
on
by
me
at
billiards
thomas
you're
not
properly
awake
old
friend
know
that
feeling
turn
over
on
the
other
side
and
take
deep
breath
thomas
rose
and
stretched
himself
and
went
over
to
the
cue
rack
you
should
have
heard
him
siding
about
his
blessed
billiards
this
morning
he
told
myra
didn't
side
simply
said
that
anybody
could
beat
thomas
do
they
play
billiards
much
at
the
admiralty
should
have
thought
the
motion
take
cue
myra
will
mark
rather
can
mark
like
anything
once
upon
time
said
there
was
lad
who
wanted
to
get
into
the
admiralty
but
his
mother
said
not
until
you
have
learnt
to
swim
thomas
so
he
had
set
of
six

lessons
for
one
guinea
before
he
went
in
for
the
examination
he
came
out
thirty-eight
and
was
offered
lucrative
appointment
in
the
post
office
hence
his
enormous
skill
at
billiards
thick
or
clear
will
adventure
half-a
crown
upon
the

said
thomas
giving

marker
i'm
spot
hadn't
you
better
oil
the
board
bit
well
as
long
as
you
can
work
it
quickly
enough
took
careful
aim
and
my
ball
went
up
the
table
and
back
again
with
the
idea
imagine
of
inspecting
the
wicket
it
seemed
quite
fast
one
all
said
myra
and
thomas
kindly
brought
his
ball
and
mine
to
the
top
of
the
table
fancy
shall
be
able
to
swerve
from
this
end
said
tried
delicate
cannon
and
just
missed
the
object
ball
shall
find
spot
directly
there's
one
under
the
red
ball
believe
do
try
and
hit
something
said
myra
the
marker
is
not
allowed
to
give
advice
said
sternly
what's
the
matter
thomas
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
think
you
ought
to
chalk
your
cue
here
said
after
examining
the
position
i've
done
that
then
ram
the
red
thomas
rammed
and
all
but
sank
it
in
the
left-hand
pocket
am
now
said
going
to
do
cannon
off
the
cushion
marker
what
is
my
score
one
sir
then
kindly
get
ready
to
put
it
up
to
three
rotten
luck
wrong
side
said
myra
judicially
no
meant
to
hit
it
that
side
mean
you
wanted
little
running
side
this
isn't
queen's
club
go
on
thomas
thomas
who
had
been
chalking
his
cue
advanced
to
the
table
hallo
he
said
where's
the
other
ball
looked
at
the
table
and
there
were
only
two
balls
on
it
that's
an
extraordinary
thing
said
in
amazement
i'm
almost
certain
we
started
with
three
did
you
put
me
down
certainly
not
shouldn't
dream
of
doing
such
thing
don't
say
mayn't
have
slipped
down
myself
when
nobody
was
looking
myra
did
you
notice
which
pocket
was
trying
for
that
time
we
felt
in
all
of
them
and
at
last
found
my
ball
in
one
of
the
bottom
ones
it
must
have
gone
there
very
quietly
score
marker
asked
confidently
as
prepared
to
continue
my
break
oh
you're
going
over
the
crease
cried
myra
took
my
ball
back
an
inch
will
you
tell
me
the
score
said
stevenson
in
play
three
inman
two
inman's
two
were
both
wides
barely
were
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
when
inman's
score
was
increased
by
no-ball
miss-cue
they
call
it
technically
three
all
said
myra
this
is
awfully
exciting
first
one
is
ahead
and
then
the
other
by
the
way
how
many
up
are
we
playing
five
aren't
you
said
myra
this
roused
thomas
he
had
played
himself
in
and
now
proceeded
to
make
pretty
break
of
seventeen
followed
there
was
collision
off
the
middle
pocket
between
spot
and
red
and
both
went
down
then
plain
was
unintentionally
sunk
as
the
result
of
cannon
shot
and
spot
and
red
sailed
into
harbour
with
thomas's
miss
scored
eleven
unfortunately
off
my
next
stroke
thomas
again
went
down
billiards
he
said
you
don't
think
want
to
put
the
rotten
thing
down
do
you
it's
such
blessed
rabbit
directly
it
sees
hole
anywhere
it
makes
for
it
hallo
six
more
shall
now
give
what
they
call
miss
in
baulk
oh
good
miss
cried
myra
as
spot
rested
over
the
middle
pocket
that
was
googly
you
both
thought
it
would
break
the
other
way
the
game
went
on
slowly
when
thomas
was
ninety
and
was
ninety-nine
there
was
confused
noise
without
and
archie
and
miss
blair
burst
into
the
room
at
least
only
archie
actually
burst
miss
blair
entered
sedately
who's
winning
cried
archie
what
an
absurd
question
said
as
if
we
should
tell
you
all
right
dahl
miss
blair
have
you
ever
seen
billiards
played
really
well
never
then
now's
your
chance
ninety
ninety-nine
they've
only
just
begun
this
is
thomas's
first
break
expect
there
he's
got
clear
board
you
get
five
extra
for
that
and
the
other
man
is
rubiconed
ninety-nine
all
now
it
is
only
question
of
who
misses
first
put
down
my
cue
thomas
began
we
have
said
some
hard
things
about
each
other
to-night
but
when
listen
to
archie
feel
very
friendly
towards
you
archibald
said
thomas
is
beastly
name
so
told
miss
blair
for
man
who
was
so
to
speak
born
with
silver
billiard-table
in
his
mouth
to
come
here
and
make
fun
of
two
persevering
and
in
my
case
promising
players
is
you'll
never
finish
that
sentence
said
myra
try
some
more
billiards
it
was
almost
impossible
to
say
what
wanted
to
say
grammatically
answered
and
hit
my
ball
very
hard
up
the
table
at
the
white
it's
working
across
said
archie
after
the
second
bounce
it
must
hit
the
red
soon
give
it
three
more
laps
it's
going
much
more
slowly
now
said
miss
blair
probably
it's
keeping
bit
of
sprint
for
the
finish
wait
till
it
gets
its
second
wind
no
i'm
afraid
it's
no
good
it
ought
to
have
started
sooner
hallo
yes
it's
got
him
it
hasn't
finished
yet
said
calmly
look
there
jove
said
archie
shaking
my
hand
that's
the
longest
loser
i've
ever
seen
my
dear
old
man
what
performer
the
practice
you
must
have
had
the
years
you
must
have
devoted
to
the
game
wonder
could
you
possibly
spare
an
hour
or
two
to-morrow
to
play
cricket
for
us
chapter
iv
few
wires
hundred
and
eighty
for
none
the
umpire
waved
his
lily
hand
and
the
scorer
entered
one
more
four
in
his
book
seeing
that
the
ball
had
gone
right
through
bicycle
which
was
leaning
up
against
the
pavilion
many
people
the
owner
of
the
bicycle
anyhow
must
have
felt
that
the
actual
signalling
of
boundary
was
unnecessary
but
our
umpire
is
stickler
for
the
etiquette
of
the
game
once
when
but
no
on
second
thoughts
sha'n't
tell
you
that
story
you
would
say
it
was
lie
as
indeed
it
is
rotten
said
archie
to
me
as
we
crossed
over
good
captain
always
confides
in
his
wicket-keeper
don't
take
simpson
off
said
like
watching
him
shall
go
on
again
myself
soon
oh
it's
not
so
bad
as
that
don't
lose
heart
the
score
was
two
hundred
when
we
met
again
once
read
book
by
lady
said
in
which
the
hero
started
the
over
with
his
right
hand
and
finished
it
with
his
left
suppose
simpson
couldn't
do
that
he's
darned
rotten
bowler
anyway
his
direction
is
all
right
but
his
metre
is
so
irregular
at
the
end
of
the
next
over
what
shall
do
asked
archie
in
despair
put
the
wicket-keeper
on
said
at
once
the
idea
was
quite
new
one
to
him
he
considered
it
for
moment
can
you
bowl
he
said
at
last
no
then
what
on
earth
look
here
you've
tried
em
with
people
who
can
bowl
and
they've
made
two
hundred
and
twenty
in
an
hour
and
half
somebody
who
can't
bowl
will
be
little
change
for
them
that's
one
reason
the
second
is
that
we
shall
all
have
bit
of
rest
while
i'm
taking
my
things
off
the
third
is
that
bet
myra
shilling
archie
knelt
down
and
began
to
unbuckle
my
pads
i'll
keep'
myself
he
said
are
you
fast
or
slow
haven't
the
faintest
idea
just
as
it
occurs
to
me
at
the
moment
expect
well
you're
quite
right
you
can't
be
worse
than
some
of
us
will
you
have
few
balls
down
first
no
thanks
should
like
to
come
as
surprise
to
them
well
pitch
em
up
anyhow
shall
probably
vary
my
length
if
possible
without
any
alteration
of
action
am
now
approaching
the
incredible
the
gentle
reader
however
must
not
be
nasty
about
it
he
should
at
least
pretend
to
believe
and
his
best
way
of
doing
this
is
to
listen
very
silently
to
what
follows
when
he
has
heard
my
explanation
shall
assume
that
he
understands
bowling
is
entirely
question
of
when
you
let
go
of
the
ball
if
you
let
go
too
soon
the
result
is
wide
over
the
batsman's
head
if
too
late
nasty
crack
on
your
own
foot
obviously
there
are
spaces
in
between
by
the
law
of
averages
one
must
let
go
at
the
right
moment
at
least
once
why
not
then
at
the
first
ball
and
in
the
case
of
person
like
myself
who
has
very
high
action
and
good
mouth
mean
who
has
very
high
delivery
such
ball
after
week
of
simpsons
and
archies
would
be
almost
unplayable
very
well
then
did
let
go
at
the
right
moment
but
unfortunately
took
off
from
the
wrong
crease
the
umpire's
cry
of
no-ball
and
the
shattering
of
the
quidnunc's
wicket
occurred
simultaneously
good
ball
said
archie
oh
bad
luck
tried
to
look
as
though
on
the
whole
preferred
it
that
way
as
being
ultimately
more
likely
to
inspire
terror
in
the
batsman
at
my
end
certainly
it
gave
me
confidence
made
me
over-confident
in
fact
so
that
held
on
to
the
next
ball
much
too
long
and
it
started
bouncing
almost
at
once
the
quidnunc
who
was
convinced
by
this
that
he
had
been
merely
having
go
at
the
previous
ball
shouldered
his
bat
and
sneered
at
it
he
was
still
sneering
when
it
came
in
very
quickly
and
took
the
bottom
of
the
leg
stump
finger
spin
chiefly
archie
walked
up
slowly
and
gazed
at
me
well
said
jauntily
no
don't
speak
just
want
to
look
and
look
and
look
it's
wonderful
no
elastic
up
the
sleeve
or
anything
this
is
where
it
first
pitched
said
the
major
as
he
examined
the
ground
did
you
think
of
letting
in
brass
tablet
inquired
shortly
he
is
quite
young
man
went
on
archie
dreamily
and
does
not
care
to
speak
about
his
plans
for
the
future
but
he
is
of
opinion
that
break
break
break
said
simpson
three
altogether
look
here
is
there
anybody
else
who
wants
to
say
anything
no
then
i'll
go
on
with
my
over
archie
who
had
begun
to
walk
back
to
his
place
returned
thoughtfully
to
me
just
wanted
to
say
old
chap
that
if
you're
writing
home
to-night
about
it
you
might
remember
me
to
your
people
blair
was
about
the
only
person
who
didn't
insult
me
this
was
because
he
had
been
fielding
long-on
and
as
soon
as
the
wicket
fell
he
moved
round
about
fifty
yards
to
talk
to
miss
fortescue
what
people
can
see
in
her
well
directly
my
next
ball
was
bowled
he
started
running
as
hard
as
he
could
to
square
leg
and
brought
off
one
of
the
finest
catches
i've
ever
seen
the
old
square-leg
trap
said
archie
but
you
cut
it
rather
fine
didn't
you
suppose
you
knew
he
was
sprinter
didn't
cut
it
at
all
was
bowling
go
away
yes
confess
it
did
the
hat
trick
it
was
good
length
half-volley
and
the
batsman
who
had
watched
my
first
three
balls
was
palpably
nervous
archie
walked
round
and
round
me
in
silence
for
some
time
and
then
went
over
to
thomas
he's
playing
tennis
with
me
this
evening
he
began
was
beaten
at
billiards
by
him
last
night
said
thomas
proudly
he's
going
to
let
me
call
him
by
his
christian
name
they
say
he's
an
awfully
good
chap
when
you
know
him
replied
thomas
got
another
wicket
with
the
last
ball
of
the
over
and
then
we
had
lunch
myra
was
smiling
all
over
her
face
when
we
came
in
but
beyond
well
bowled
walter
which
believe
to
be
brearley's
name
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
instead
she
seized
archie
and
talked
long
and
eagerly
to
him
and
they
both
laughed
good
deal
arkwright
heard
archie
say
at
the
end
he's
sure
to
be
there
and
would
do
it
like
shot
like
wise
captain
archie
did
not
put
me
on
after
lunch
and
simpson
soon
began
to
have
the
tail
in
difficulties
just
after
the
eighth
wicket
fell
telegram
came
out
archie
took
it
and
handed
it
to
me
from
maclaren
expect
he
said
with
grin
you
funny
ass
happen
to
know
it's
from
dick
asked
him
for
wire
about
the
kent
match
oh
did
kent
win
said
archie
looking
over
my
shoulder
as
opened
it
the
others
came
up
and
read
please
be
in
attendance
for
next
test
match
hawke
got
three
more
that
afternoon
one
from
fry
one
from
leveson-gower
and
one
from
maclaren
they
all
came
from
lord's
and
i've
half
mind
to
take
my
telegrams
with
me
and
go
then
myra
would
probably
get
six
months
in
the
second
division
but
shouldn't
mind
that
said
myra
you
could
easily
bowl
mean
bail
me
out
silly
joke
call
it
chapter
at
play
selected
handkerchief
gave
last
look
at
the
weather
which
was
beastly
and
went
down
very
late
to
breakfast
as
opened
the
door
there
was
sudden
hush
everybody
looked
eagerly
at
me
then
miss
fortescue
tittered
well
you
know
how
one
feels
when
that
happens
put
my
hand
quickly
to
my
tie
it
was
still
there
squinted
down
my
nose
but
there
was
no
smut
to
make
quite
sure
went
over
to
the
glass
then
simpson
exploded
yet
nobody
spoke
they
all
sat
there
watching
me
and
at
last
began
to
get
nervous
opened
my
mouth
to
say
good-morning
but
before
got
it
out
miss
blair
gave
little
shriek
of
excitement
that
upset
me
altogether
walked
up
to
the
tea-pot
and
pouring
myself
out
cup
said
with
exaggerated
carelessness
rotten
day
isn't
it
and
then
came
the
laughter
shout
after
shout
held
out
my
hand
to
myra
good-bye
said
i'm
going
home
thank
you
for
very
jolly
time
but
i'm
not
going
to
be
bullied
oh
you
dear
she
gurgled
am
rather
sweet
before
breakfast
admitted
but
how
it
was
too
heavenly
of
you
never
thought
you
would
think
shall
go
back
to
bed
it
was
rather
rough
luck
said
archie
but
of
course
the
later
you
are
the
worse
it
is
for
you
and
the
higher
the
fewer
quite
so
if
this
is
from
breakfast
table
topics
in
the
daily
mirror
haven't
seen
them
to-day
but
i'll
do
my
best
archie
explain
archie
took
up
piece
of
paper
from
the
table
and
explained
it's
like
this
he
said
came
down
first
and
looked
at
the
weather
and
said
anyone
would
put
in
quickly
well
then
blair
came
in
and
said
beastly
day
and
then
simpson
well
thought
i'd
write
down
everybody's
first
remark
to
see
if
anybody
let
the
weather
alone
here
they
are
it's
awful
put
in
myra
to
have
one's
remarks
taken
down
straight
off
i've
quite
forgotten
what
said
this
was
the
list
archie
bother
so
he
says
blair
what
beastly
day
simpson
what
jolly
day
the
major
well
not
much
cricket
to-day
hey
myra
oh
dear
what
day
miss
blair
what
terrible
day
miss
fortescue
oh
you
poor
men
what
day
thomas
rotten
day
isn't
it
me
rotten
day
isn't
it
don't
think
much
of
thomas's
remark
said
later
on
in
the
morning
we
met
all
except
the
major
that
is
in
the
room
which
myra
calls
hers
and
archie
calls
the
nursery
and
tried
to
think
of
something
to
do
i'm
not
going
to
play
bridge
all
day
for
anyone
said
archie
the
host
should
lay
himself
out
to
amuse
his
guests
said
myra
otherwise
his
guests
will
lay
him
out
warned
him
to
amuse
themselves
well
what
do
you
all
want
to
do
should
like
to
look
at
photograph
album
said
thomas
stump
cricket
what
about
hide-and
seek
no
i've
got
it

by
the
water-beetle
sound

the
trumpet

the
drum
to
all
the
scouting
world

one
crowded
stalk
upon
the
turn
is
worth
an
age
without
name
archie
shrieked
myra
in
horror
it
is
too
late
she
added
all
the
ladies

swooned
we
arranged
sides
myra
and
and
simpson
and
thomas
against
the
others
they
were
to
start
first

isn't
simply
hide-and
seek
said
archie
as
they
went
off
you've
got
to
track
us
fairly
we
shall
probably
blaze'
door-posts
when
you
hear
the
bleat
of
tinned
sardine
that
means
we're
ready
keep
your
eyes
skinned
my
hearties
and
heaven
defend
the
right
we
ought
to
have
bare
knees
really
said
myra
when
they'd
gone
boy
scouts
always
do
so
that
when
they
go
through
bed
of
nettles
they
know
they've
been
shall
stalk
the
stairs
to
begin
with
said
simpson
you
go
down
the
back
way
and
look
as
much
like
vacuum-cleaner
as
possible
then
they
won't
notice
you
thomas
and
myra
hush
listen
was
that
the
bleat
of
fresh
sardine
or
the
tinned
variety
tinned
said
myra
let's
go
we
went
took
the
queen
anne
staircase
on
my
in
the
proper
stalking
position
moved
very
slowly
searching
for
spoor
half-way
down
the
stairs
my
back
fin
slipped
and
shot
over
the
old
oak
at
tremendous
pace
landing
in
the
hall
like
channel
swimmer
looking
up
saw
thomas
in
front
of
me
he
was
examining
the
door
for
blazes
myra
was
next
to
him
her
ear
to
the
ground
listening
for
the
gallop
of
horses'
hoofs
got
up
and
went
over
to
them
hast
seen
aught
of
comely
wench
in
parlous
case
hight
mistress
dahlia
asked
thomas
boy
scouts
don't
talk
like
that
he
said
gruffly
beg
your
pardon
was
thinking
that
was
cavalier
and
you
were
roundhead
now
perceive
that
you
are
just
an
ordinary
fathead
why
said
myra
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
what
does
this
button
mean
have
found
clue
examined
it
and
then
looked
at
my
own
coat
you
have
said
somebody
has
been
down
those
stairs
quite
recently
for
the
button
is
still
warm
where
is
scout
simpson
at
that
moment
he
appeared
breathless
with
excitement
have
had
an
adventure
he
said
hurriedly
without
saluting
was
on
the
back
stairs
looking
like
vacuum-cleaner
when
suddenly
archie
and
miss
blair
appeared
they
looked
right
at
me
but
didn't
seem
to
penetrate
my
disguise
archie
in
fact
leant
against
me
and
said
to
miss
blair
will
now
tell
you
of
my
secret
mission
carry
caviare
mean
despatches
to
the
general
breathe
but
word
of
this
to
the
enemy
and
miss
the
half-holiday
on
saturday
come
let
us
be
going
but
first
to
burn
the
secret
code
and
and
then
he
struck
match
on
me
and
burned
it
myra
gurgled
and
hastily
looked
solemn
again
proceed
scout
simpson
she
said
for
the
night
approaches
apace
well
then
they
started
down
the
stairs
and
went
after
them
on
my
scouting
you
know
made
rather
noise
at
one
corner
and
archie
looked
round
at
me
and
said
to
miss
blair
the
tadpoles
are
out
full
early
see
yonder
where
one
lies
basking
and
he
came
back
and
put
his
foot
on
me
and
said
nay
tis
but
shadow
let
us
return
right
hastily
yet
tarry
moment
what
time
lay
false
trail
so
they
tarried
and
he
wrote
note
and
dropped
it
on
me
and
afterwards
got
up
and
here
it
is
the
secret
despatch
cried
myra
it's
addressed
to
the
scoutmistress
and
it
says
outside
private
not
to
be
opened
till
christmas
day
myra
opened
it
and
read
your
blessed
scouts
are
everywhere
let
me
just
have
five
minutes
with
her
in
the
nursery
there's
dear
i'd
do
as
much
for
you
but
she
didn't
read
it
aloud
and
didn't
see
it
till
some
time
afterwards
she
simply
put
it
away
and
smiled
and
announced
that
the
scouts
would
now
adjourn
to
the
billiard-room
for
pemmican
and
other
refreshments
which
they
did
the
engagement
was
announced
that
evening
chapter
vi
in
and
out
well
said
thomas
how
are
we
going
to
celebrate
the
joyful
event
we
were
sitting
on
the
lawn
watching
blair
and
miss
fortescue
play
croquet
archie
and
dahlia
were
not
with
us
they
had
suppose
private
matters
to
discuss
our
match
did
not
begin
for
another
hour
happily
for
the
lovers
happily
also
for
the
croquet-players
who
had
about
fifty-six
more
hoops
posts
flags
and
what
not
to
negotiate
it's
awfully
difficult
to
realise
it
said
myra
my
own
brother
just
fancy
can
hardly
believe
it
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
said
something's
happened
to
him
anyhow
he's
promised
to
put
me
in
first
to-day
let's
have
dance
to-morrow
night
continued
thomas
relentlessly
pursuing
his
original
idea
and
we'll
all
dance
with
miss
blair
yes
archie
would
like
that
remember
some
years
ago
when
was
in
spain
said
simpson
this
murmured
appreciatively
is
how
all
the
best
stories
begin
and
settled
myself
more
comfortably
in
my
chair
no
said
simpson
i'm
wrong
there
it
was
in
hampstead
and
he
returned
to
his
meditations
tell
you
what
said
thomas
you
ought
to
write
em
an
ode
simpson
there's
nothing
that
rhymes
with
the
lady
there's
hair
said
quite
unintentionally
meant
with
dahlia
my
dear
man
there
are
heaps
why
there's
azalea
that's
only
one
well
there
are
lots
of
different
kinds
of
azalea
any
rhymes
for
archie
and
mannering
said
simpson
scornfully
certainly
and
simpson
you
might
end
with
him
forgive
the
way
the
metre
limps
on
it's
always
like
that
with
samuel
simpson
you
get
the
idea
hush
said
myra
miss
fortescue
has
passed
under
hoop
but
it
is
time
that
we
got
on
to
my
innings
archie
managed
to
win
the
toss
and
as
he
had
promised
took
me
in
with
him
it
was
the
proudest
and
most
nervous
moment
of
my
life
i've
never
been
in
first
before
said
as
we
walked
to
the
wickets
is
there
any
little
etiquette
to
observe
oh
rather
especially
if
you're
going
to
take
first
ball
oh
there's
no
doubt
about
my
taking
the
first
ball
in
that
case
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
when
the
umpire
calls
play'
the
side
refusing
to
play
loses
the
match
then
it
all
rests
on
me
your
confidence
in
me
must
be
immense
think
shall
probably
consent
to
play
obtained
guard
and
took
my
stand
at
the
wicket
most
cricketers
nowadays
am
told
adopt
the
two-eyed
stance
but
for
myself
still
stick
to
the
good
old
two-legged
one
it
seems
to
me
to
be
less
wearing
my
style
should
observe
blends
happily
the
dash
of
joseph
vine
with
the
patience
of
kenneth
hutchings
and
after
long
innings
find
glass
of
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
it
now
but
know
find
it
very
refreshing
being
the
hero
you
will
admit
that
after
my
hat
trick
of
this
true
story
feel
must
describe
my
innings
carefully
though
it
only
totalled
seventeen
there
was
this
to
be
said
for
it
it
is
the
only
innings
of
less
than
hundred
ever
made
by
hero
it
began
with
cut
to
square
leg
for
which
we
ran
forced
single
and
followed
on
with
brace
of
ones
in
the
direction
of
fine
slip
after
that
stopped
the
bowler
in
the
middle
of
his
run-up
and
signalled
to
spectator
to
move
away
from
the
screen
this
was
put-up
job
with
myra
and
rather
hoped
they
would
give
me
something
for
it
but
apparently
they
didn't
at
the
end
of
the
over
went
up
and
talked
to
archie
in
first-class
cricket
the
batsmen
often
do
this
and
it
impresses
the
spectators
immensely
said
bet
you
shilling
i'm
out
next
over
he
said
won't
take
you
said
then
huff
you
and
went
back
to
my
crease
my
next
scoring
stroke
was
two-eyed
hook
over
point's
head
and
then
archie
hit
three
fours
running
had
another
short
conversation
with
him
in
the
course
of
which
recited
two
lines
from
shakespeare
and
asked
him
small
but
pointed
conundrum
and
afterwards
placed
the
ball
cleverly
to
mid-off
the
agility
of
the
fieldsman
however
preventing
any
increment
unearned
or
otherwise
finally
gave
my
cap
to
the
umpire
made
some
more
ones
changed
my
bat
and
was
caught
at
the
wicket
hit
it
said
as
walked
away
said
it
to
nobody
in
particular
but
the
umpire
refused
to
alter
his
decision
congratulate
you
said
miss
blair
when
was
sitting
down
again
was
just
going
to
do
that
to
you
said
oh
but
you
were
kind
enough
to
do
that
last
night
ah
this
is
extra
i've
just
been
batting
out
there
with
your
young
man
perhaps
you
noticed
well
think
must
have
yes
well
wanted
to
tell
you
that
think
he
has
quite
an
idea
of
the
game
and
that
with
more
experience
he
would
probably
be
good
enough
to
play
for
for
surrey
second
eleven
yes
at
hockey
thank
you
so
much
you've
known
him
long
time
haven't
you
we
were
babes
together
madam
at
least
simultaneously
we
actually
met
at
school
he
had
blue
eyes
and
curly
hair
and
fought
the
captain
on
the
very
first
day
on
the
second
day
his
hair
was
still
curly
but
he
had
black
eyes
on
the
third
day
he
got
into
the
cricket
eleven
and
on
the
fourth
he
was
given
his
footer
cap
afterwards
he
sang
in
the
choir
and
won
the
competition
for
graceful
diving
it
was
not
until
his
second
term
that
the
headmaster
really
began
to
confide
in
him
by
the
way
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
yes
smiled
dahlia
something
like
that
well
then
we
went
to
cambridge
together
he
never
did
much
work
but
his
algebra
paper
in
the
little
go
was
so
brilliant
that
they
offered
him
the
senior
wranglership
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
it
might
interfere
with
his
training
for
the
tug
of
war
for
which
he
had
just
obtained
his
blue
and
it's
great
strain
making
all
this
up
do
you
mind
if
stop
now
of
course
know
that
isn't
all
true
but
he
is
like
that
isn't
he
he
is
he
put
me
in
first
to-day
know
you
really
are
fond
of
him
lorblessyou
yes
that
makes
you
my
friend
too
of
course
patted
her
hand
that
reminds
me
as
friend
feel
bound
to
warn
you
that
there
is
person
about
in
the
neighbourhood
called
samuel
simpson
who
meditates
an
evil
design
upon
you
and
yours
in
short
poem
in
this
he
will
liken
you
to
the
azalea
which
take
to
be
kind
of
shrubby
plant
yes
yes
well
all
want
to
say
is
if
he
comes
round
with
the
hat
afterwards
don't
put
anything
in
poor
man
smiled
dahlia
that's
his
living
isn't
it
yes
that's
why
say
don't
put
anything
in
see
oh
there
he's
out
poor
archie
are
you
very
sorry
said
smiling
at
her
i'm
just
going
you
know
between
ourselves
said
later
to
myra
that
isn't
at
all
bad
girl
oh
fancy
but
didn't
come
to
talk
about
her
came
to
talk
about
my
seventeen
yes
do
let's
yes
er
you
begin
chapter
vii
all
over
may
have
dance
asked
miss
blair
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
considered
one
two
three
the
next
but
five
she
said
thank
you
that
sounds
lot
is
it
only
one
you
may
have
two
running
then
if
you
like
what
about
two
running
and
one
hopping
and
one
really
gliding
four
altogether
we'll
see
said
miss
blair
gravely
myra
who
was
being
very
busy
came
up
and
dragged
me
away
want
to
introduce
you
to
somebody
say
have
you
seen
thomas
it's
no
earthly
good
introducing
me
to
thomas
again
he's
so
important
because
he
thinks
the
dance
was
his
idea
of
course
i'd
meant
to
have
it
all
along
there
she
is
her
name's
dora
dalton
think
it's
dora
shall
call
her
dora
anyhow
was
introduced
and
we
had
very
jolly
waltz
together
she
danced
delightfully
and
when
we
had
found
comfortable
corner
she
began
to
talk
she
said
do
you
play
cricket
was
rather
surprised
but
kept
quite
cool
and
said
yes
my
brother's
very
fond
of
it
he
is
very
good
too
he
was
playing
here
yesterday
against
mr
mannering's
team
and
made
six
and
then
the
umpire
gave
him
out
but
he
wasn't
out
really
and
he
was
very
angry
don't
wonder
do
you
had
sudden
horrible
suspicion
did
you
say
your
name
was
dora
mean
his
name
was
dalton
yes
and
just
because
he
was
angry
which
anybody
would
be
the
wicket-keeper
was
very
rude
and
told
him
to
go
home
and
and
bake
his
head
not
bake
said
gently
my
suspicion
having
now
become
almost
certainty
boil
go
home
and
boil
his
head
she
repeated
indignantly
and
did
he
did
he
what
er
did
he
understand
mean
don't
you
think
your
brother
may
have
misunderstood
can't
believe
that
wicket-keeper
would
ever
demean
himself
by
using
the
word
boil
not
as
you
might
say
boil
cool
his
head'
was
probably
the
expression
it
was
very
hot
day
remember
and
ah
there's
the
music
beginning
again
shall
we
go
back
am
afraid
miss
dalton's
version
of
the
incident
was
not
quite
accurate
what
had
happened
was
this
had
stumped
the
fellow
when
he
was
nearly
mile
and
half
outside
his
crease
and
when
he
got
back
to
it
some
minutes
later
and
found
the
umpire's
hand
up
he
was
extremely
indignant
and
dramatic
about
it
quite
to
myself
sotto
voce
as
it
were
murmured
oh
go
home
and
may
have
called
attention
in
some
way
to
the
bails
but
as
to
passing
any
remarks
about
boiling
heads
well
it
simply
never
occurred
to
me
had
dance
with
myra
shortly
after
this
she
had
been
so
busy
and
important
that
felt
quite
stranger
adapted
my
conversation
accordingly
it's
very
jolly
floor
isn't
it
said
as
brought
her
an
ice
oh
yes
said
myra
in
the
same
spirit
have
you
been
to
many
floors
mean
dances
lately
oh
yes
so
have
think
dances
have
been
very
late
lately
think
when
the
floor's
nice
it
doesn't
matter
about
the
ices
don't
you
think
the
band
is
rather
too
elastic
mean
keeps
very
good
time
think
so
long
as
the
time
is
good
it
doesn't
matter
about
the
floor
oh
isn't
it
said
myra
enthusiastically
there
was
pleasant
pause
while
we
both
thought
of
something
else
to
say
have
you
we
began
beg
your
pardon
we
said
at
once
was
going
to
say
myra
went
on
have
you
read
any
nice
books
lately
or
are
you
fonder
of
tennis
like
reading
nice
books
about
tennis
said
if
they
are
nice
books
and
are
really
about
tennis
er
do
you
live
in
london
yes
it
is
so
handy
for
the
theatres
isn't
it
there
is
no
place
exactly
like
london
is
there
mean
it's
so
different
well
of
course
up
in
liverpool
we
do
get
the
trams
you
know
now
say
i'm
tired
of
pretending
i've
only
just
met
you
let's
talk
properly
at
this
moment
we
heard
voice
say
let's
try
in
here
and
archie
and
dahlia
appeared
hallo
here's
the
happy
pair
said
myra
they
came
in
and
looked
at
us
diffidently
leant
back
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
were
you
just
going
said
archie
we
were
not
said
then
we'll
stay
and
talk
to
you
we
were
in
the
middle
of
an
important
conversation
oh
don't
mind
us
thank
you
it's
really
for
your
benefit
so
you'd
better
listen
let
me
see
where
were
we
oh
yes
one
pound
of
beef
ninepence
three
pounds
of
potatoes
fourpence
one
piece
of
emery
paper
for
the
blanc-mange
tuppence
one
pound
of
india-rubber
dahlia
darling
interrupted
myra
in
fair
imitation
of
archie's
voice
how
often
have
told
you
that
we
can't
afford
india-rubber
in
the
cake
just
few
raisins
and
cherry
is
really
all
you
want
you
mustn't
be
so
extravagant
dearest
do
try
and
after
all
love
it
wasn't
who
fell
into
the
cocoa
last
night
didn't
fall
in
simply
dropped
my
pipe
in
and
it
was
you
insisted
on
pouring
it
away
afterwards
and
then
look
at
this
one
yard
of
lace
that's
for
the
cutlets
suppose
for
people
in
our
circumstances
paper
frillings
are
quite
sufficient
archie
and
dahlia
listened
to
us
with
open
mouths
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
us
again
is
there
any
more
asked
archie
there's
lots
more
but
we've
forgotten
it
you
aren't
ill
or
anything
we
are
both
perfectly
well
how's
miss
dalton
dora
said
is
also
well
so
is
miss
fortescue
and
so
is
thomas
we
are
all
well
thought
perhaps
no
there
you
are
wrong
expect
it's
just
the
heat
and
the
excitement
said
dahlia
with
smile
it
takes
some
people
like
that
i'm
afraid
you
miss
our
little
parable
said
myra
we
do
come
on
dahlia
you'll
pardon
me
archibald
but
miss
blair
is
dancing
this
with
me
archie
objected
strongly
but
left
him
with
myra
and
took
miss
blair
away
we
sat
on
the
stairs
and
thought
it
has
been
lovely
week
said
dahlia
it
has
agreed
perhaps
more
lovely
for
me
than
for
you
that's
just
where
don't
agree
with
you
you
know
we
think
it's
greatly
over-rated
falling
in
love
mean
who's
we'
myra
and
we've
been
talking
it
over
that's
why
we
rather
dwelt
upon
the
sordid
side
of
it
just
now
suppose
we
didn't
move
you
at
all
no
said
dahlia
we're
settled
that's
exactly
it
said
should
hate
to
be
settled
it's
so
much
more
fun
like
this
myra
quite
agrees
with
me
dahlia
smiled
to
herself
but
perhaps
some
day
she
began
don't
know
never
look
more
than
week
ahead
it
has
been
great
fun
this
week
and
it
will
probably
be
great
fun
next
week
that's
my
motto
well
ye
es
said
miss
blair
doubtfully
part
ii
chapter
one
of
the
players
do
know
everybody
asked
myra
towards
the
end
of
the
dinner
looking
round
the
table
think
so
said
myra
if
there's
anybody
you
don't
see
in
the
window
ask
for
him
can
see
most
of
them
who's
that
tall
handsome
fellow
grinning
at
me
now
me
said
archie
smiling
across
at
us
go
away
said
myra
gentlemen
shouldn't
eavesdrop
this
is
perfectly
private
conversation
you've
got
lady
on
each
side
of
you
said
heatedly
why
don't
you
talk
to
them
it's
simply
scandalous
that
myra
and
can't
get
moment
to
ourselves
they're
both
busy
they
won't
have
anything
to
say
to
me
then
pull
cracker
with
yourself
surely
you
can
think
of
something
my
lad
he
has
very
jealous
disposition
said
myra
and
whenever
dahlia
bother
he's
not
listening
looked
round
the
table
again
to
see
if
could
spy
stranger
there's
man
over
there
who's
he
where
this
orange
is
pointing
oranges
don't
point
waggle
your
knife
round
oh
him
yes
he's
friend
of
archie's
mr
derry
who
is
he
does
he
do
anything
exciting
he
does
rather
you
know
those
little
riddles
in
the
christmas
crackers
yes
yes
well
he
couldn't
very
well
do
those
because
he's
an
electrical
engineer
but
why
no
didn't
simply
asked
you
if
you
knew
them
and
he
plays
the
piano
beautifully
and
he's
rather
good
actor
and
he
never
gets
up
till
about
ten
because
his
room
is
next
to
mine
and
you
can
hear
everything
and
can
hear
him
not
getting
up
that
doesn't
sound
much
like
an
electrical
engineer
you
ask
him
suddenly
what
amperes
are
penny
and
see
if
he
turns
pale
expect
he
makes
up
the
riddles
after
all
simpson
only
does
the
mottoes
know
now
talk
to
thomas
for
bit
while
drink
my
orange
five
minutes
elapsed
or
transpired
whichever
it
is
before
was
ready
to
talk
again
generally
after
an
orange
want
to
have
bath
and
go
straight
off
to
bed
but
this
particular
one
had
not
been
so
all-overish
as
usual
now
then
said
as
examined
the
crystallised
fruit
i'm
with
you
in
one
minute
myra
turned
round
and
looked
absently
at
me
don't
know
how
to
begin
she
said
to
herself
the
beginning's
easy
enough
explained
as
took
dish
of
green
sweets
under
my
charge
it's
the
knowing
when
to
stop
can
you
eat
those
and
listen
to
something
serious
i'll
try
yes
can
eat
them
all
right
now
let's
see
if
can
listen
yes
can
listen
all
right
then
it's
this
i've
been
putting
it
off
as
long
as
can
but
you've
got
to
be
told
to-night
it's
well
do
you
know
why
you're
here
of
course
do
haven't
just
been
showing
you
well
why
are
you
here
well
frankly
because
i'm
hungry
suppose
of
course
know
that
if
hadn't
been
should
have
come
in
to
dinner
just
the
same
but
hang
it
mean
that's
the
root
idea
of
dining-room
isn't
it
and
am
hungry
at
least
was
stave
it
off
again
with
an
almond
said
myra
pushing
them
along
to
me
what
really
meant
was
why
you're
here
in
the
house
this
was
much
more
difficult
began
to
consider
possible
reasons
because
you
all
love
me
started
because
you
put
the
wrong
address
on
the
envelope
because
the
regular
boot-boy's
ill
because
you've
never
heard
me
sing
in
church
because
stop
me
when
i'm
getting
warm
because
miss
fortescue
refused
to
come
unless
was
invited
because
stop
said
myra
that
was
it
and
of
course
you
know
didn't
mean
that
at
all
what
an
awful
lot
of
things
you
don't
mean
to-night
be
brave
and
have
it
right
out
this
time
all
right
then
will
one
two
three
we're
going
to
act
play
on
saturday
she
leant
forward
and
regarded
me
with
apprehension
but
why
not
i'll
promise
to
clap
you
can't
because
you
see
you're
going
to
act
too
isn't
it
jolly
said
myra
breathlessly
gave
what
if
hadn't
just
begun
the
last
sweet
would
have
been
scornful
laugh
me
act
why
i've
never
don't
do
it
it
isn't
done
don't
act
not
on
saturdays
how
absurd
have
you
told
him
myra
dahlia
called
out
suddenly
i'm
telling
him
now
think
he's
taking
it
all
right
don't
talk
about
me
as
him'
said
angrily
and
i'm
not
taking
it
all
right
i'm
not
taking
it
at
all
it's
only
such
very
small
part
we're
all
doing
something
you
know
and
your
costume's
ordered
and
everything
but
how
awfully
sporting
of
you
after
that
what
could
say
er
what
am
asked
modestly
you're
small
rat-catcher
said
myra
cheerfully
beg
your
pardon
rat-catcher
you
said
small
one
does
that
mean
that
i'm
of
diminutive
size
or
that
i'm
in
small
way
of
business
or
that
my
special
line
is
young
ones
it
means
that
you
haven't
much
to
say
see
and
would
you
call
it
tragic
or
pathetic
part
it's
comic
part
rather
you're
hereditary
grand
rat-catcher
to
the
emperor
bong
bong
the
second
not
the
first
bong
the
dinner
bong
look
here
suppose
you
know
that
i've
never
acted
in
my
life
and
never
been
or
seen
rat-catcher
in
my
life
it
is
therefore
useless
for
you
to
tell
me
to
be
perfectly
natural
you
have
so
little
to
do
it
will
be
quite
easy
your
great
scene
is
where
you
approach
the
emperor
very
nervously
shall
do
the
nervous
part
all
right
and
beg
him
to
spare
the
life
of
his
mother-in
law
why
mean
who
is
she
miss
fortescue
yes
doubt
if
can
make
that
bit
seem
quite
so
natural
still
i'll
try
hooray
how
splendid
rat-catcher
murmured
to
myself
where
is
the
rat
the
rat
is
on
the
mat
the
cat
is
on
the
rat
the
bat
is
on
the
cat
the
mr
derry
will
go
through
your
part
with
you
to-morrow
some
of
it
is
funnier
than
that
the
electrical
engineer
what
do
they
know
about
rat-catching
nothing
only
aha
now
see
who
your
mysterious
mr
derry
is
he
is
going
to
coach
us
he
is
you've
found
it
out
at
last
how
bright
green
sweets
make
you
they
have
to
be
really
bright
green
sweets
poor
man
what
job
he'll
have
with
us
all
yes
said
myra
as
she
prepared
to
leave
me
now
you
know
why
he
doesn't
get
up
till
ten
in
the
rat-catching
business
said
thoughtfully
as
opened
the
door
the
real
rush
comes
in
the
afternoon
rat-catchers
in
consequence
never
get
up
till
ten-thirty
do
you
know
decided
am
quite
beginning
to
like
my
little
part
chapter
ii
alarms
and
excursions
was
confess
very
late
the
next
morning
even
for
rat-catcher
mr
derry
was
in
the
middle
of
his
breakfast
all
the
others
had
finished
we
saluted
and
settled
down
to
work
there
is
going
to
be
rehearsal
at
eleven
o'clock
believe
said
derry
it
must
be
nearly
that
now
shall
be
there
said
if
have
to
bring
the
marmalade
with
me
you're
going
to
coach
us
well
believe
said
would
though
have
never
assumed
the
buskin
myself
went
on
have
of
course
heard
of
you
as
an
amateur
actor
liar
and
if
you
could
tell
me
how
to
act
while
am
finishing
my
bacon
should
be
most
awfully
obliged
haven't
you
really
done
any
only
once
when
was
very
small
was
the
heroine
had
an
offer
but
had
to
refuse
it
said
alath
dear
heart
may
not
am
married
already
very
right
and
proper
murmured
derry
well
as
it
turned
out
had
made
mistake
it
was
my
first
who
had
been
married
already
the
little
play
was
full
of
surprises
like
derry
coughed
and
took
out
his
pipe
let
me
see
he
began
what's
your
part
am
er
rodent-collector
oh
yes
the
emperor's
rat-catcher
grand
hereditary
said
stiffly
it
had
been
in
the
family
for
years
quite
so
was
about
to
enlarge
upon
the
advantages
of
the
hereditary
principle
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
to
admit
myra
and
archie
you
don't
say
you're
down
at
last
said
myra
in
surprise
hardly
say
anything
at
breakfast
as
rule
pointed
out
what
an
enormous
one
you're
having
and
only
last
night
on
the
contrary
i'm
eating
practically
nothing
nut
and
one
piece
of
parsley
off
the
butter
the
fact
is
glanced
at
my
part
before
went
to
bed
and
there
seemed
such
lot
of
it
hardly
slept
at
all
why
you
don't
come
on
very
much
said
archie
neither
do
i'm
conjuror
can
any
gentleman
here
oblige
me
with
rabbit
no
sir
said
rabbit
oh
beg
your
pardon
thought
you
were
coming
up
on
to
the
stage
any
gentleman
have
some
jam
instead
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
don't
come
on
very
much
took
the
book
out
of
my
pocket
and
began
to
turn
the
leaves
here
you
are
nearly
every
page
enter
exit
enter
don't
know
who
he
is
exeunt
why
the
rat-catcher's
always
doing
something
ah
here
they're
more
explicit
enter
hallo
that's
funny
because
i'd
just
oh
see
one
of
our
oldest
and
most
experienced
mimes
said
archie
to
derry
you
must
get
him
to
talk
to
you
no
secret
of
the
boards
is
hid
from
him
added
myra
tell
us
again
sir
about
your
early
struggles
begged
archie
he
means
your
early
performances
on
the
stage
explained
myra
there's
one
very
jolly
story
about
ellen
terry
and
the
fireproof
curtain
let
me
see
were
you
macbeth
then
or
noise
of
trumpets
always
forget
drank
my
last
cup
of
tea
and
rose
with
dignity
it
is
humorous
family
apologised
to
derry
their
grandfather
was
just
the
same
he
would
have
his
little
joke
about
the
first
steam-engine
outside
in
the
hall
there
was
large
crowd
of
unemployed
all
talking
at
once
caught
the
words
ridiculous
and
rehearsal
and
the
connection
between
the
two
seemed
obvious
and
frequent
singled
out
thomas
abstracted
his
pouch
and
began
to
fill
up
what
is
all
this
acting
business
asked
some
idea
about
little
play
what
let's
toddle
off
and
have
game
of
billiards
they've
let
me
in
for
bally
part
said
thomas
and
you
needn't
think
you're
going
to
get
out
of
it
they've
got
you
down
all
right
thomas
will
be
frank
with
you
am
no
less
person
than
the
emperor
bong's
hereditary
it
had
been
in
the
family
for
years
grand
rat-catcher
the
real
rush
however
comes
in
the
afternoon
my
speciality
is
young
ones
i'm
his
executioner
and
he
has
conjuror
too
what
staff
hallo
good
morning
simpson
are
you
anything
lofty
oh
am
the
emperor
bong
said
simpson
gaily
am
beautiful
clever
and
strong
question
said
thomas
tis
my
daily
delight
to
carouse
and
to
fight
and
at
moments
burst
into
song
looked
at
him
in
amazement
well
just
at
present
said
all
want
is
match
lucifer
emp
pine
vesta
maj
thanks
now
tell
me
does
anybody
beside
yourself
burst
into
song
during
the
play
any
bursting
by
thomas
or
myself
for
instance
nobody
sings
at
all
my
little
poem
is
recitative
if
you
mean
it's
very
bad
agree
with
you
said
thomas
made
it
up
myself
it
was
thought
that
my
part
should
be
livened
up
little
well
why
hasn't
it
been
if
you
will
give
me
two
minutes
simpson
said
will
liven
up
my
own
part
better
than
that
what
rhymes
with
rat-catcher
cat-catcher
wait
bit
yes
that's
got
it
oh
i'm
on
the
emperor's
staff
i'm
rodent-collector
don't
laugh
my
record
in
braces
of
rats
and
their
races
is
thousand
and
eight
and
half
may
we
have
that
again
said
myra
appearing
suddenly
oh
i'm
on
no
said
thomas
oh
i'm
on
no
said
simpson
there
is
no
real
demand
i'm
afraid
well
did
just
hear
it
before
said
myra
wish
you'd
make
up
one
for
me
think
we
might
all
announce
ourselves
like
that
and
then
the
audience
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognising
us
they'll
recognise
thomas
if
he
comes
on
with
an
axe
they
won't
think
he's
just
trotted
round
with
the
milk
but
what
are
you
myra
the
emperor's
wife's
maid
another
member
of
the
highly
trained
staff
well
go
on
simpson
oh
am
her
majesty's
maid
declared
simpson
we
all
begin
with
oh
to
express
surprise
at
finding
ourselves
on
the
stage
at
all
oh
am
her
majesty's
maid
i'm
sad
little
flirt
i'm
afraid
i'm
respectable
steady
and
staid
corrected
myra
no
said
have
it
oh
am
her
majesty's
maid
and
her
charms
are
beginning
to
fade
can
sit
in
the
sun
and
look
just
twenty-one
while
she's
thirty-six
in
the
shade
myra
made
graceful
curtsey
thank
you
sir
you'll
have
to
pay
me
lot
more
of
those
before
the
play
is
over
will
really
well
seeing
as
the
grand
hereditary
one
is
supposed
to
be
making
up
to
her
majesty's
confidential
attendant
miss
fortescue
came
pushing
up
to
us
it
is
too
ridiculous
she
complained
none
of
us
know
our
parts
yet
and
if
we
have
rehearsal
now
what
do
you
think
about
it
looked
at
myra
and
smiled
to
myself
i'm
all
for
rehearsal
at
once
said
chapter
iii
rehearsal
now
this
is
very
simple
trick
said
archie
from
the
centre
of
the
stage
for
this
little
trick
all
want
is
hippopotamus
and
couple
of
rubies
take
the
hippopotamus
in
one
hand
so
and
cover
it
with
the
handkerchief
then
having
carefully
peeled
the
rubies
thomas
put
the
last
strip
of
silver
paper
on
to
his
axe
and
surveyed
the
result
proudly
but
how
splendid
said
myra
as
she
hurried
past
only
you
want
some
blood
and
she
jumped
over
the
footlights
and
disappeared
good
idea
archie
where
do
you
keep
the
blood
hey
presto
it's
gone
and
now
sir
if
you
will
feel
in
your
waistcoat
pockets
you
will
find
the
hippopotamus
in
the
right-hand
side
and
the
red
ink
in
the
left
no
dear
dear
the
hippopotamus
must
have
been
bad
one
be
an
artist
thomas
said
and
open
vein
or
two
do
the
thing
properly
beerbohm
but
soft
winsome
maid
in
sooth
will
approach
her
always
forget
that
sooth
bit
but
soft
win
why
don't
we
begin
asked
simpson
can't
remember
my
part
much
longer
oh
by
the
way
when
you
come
up
to
me
and
say
your
majesty
e'en
forgets
the
story
of
the
bull's-eye
and
the
revolving
bookcase
go
away
don't
say
anything
so
silly
oh
of
course
it's
blair
blair
when
you
come
up
to
me
and
say
they
retired
to
the
back
of
the
stage
to
arrange
very
effective
piece
of
business
any
card
you
like
madam
so
long
as
it
is
in
the
pack
the
queen
of
hearts
certainly
now
take
the
others
and
tear
them
up
so
the
card
remaining
will
be
yours
ah
as
thought
it
is
the
queen
of
hearts
archie
you're
talking
too
much
said
dahlia
and
none
of
it
comes
into
your
part
really
i'm
getting
the
atmosphere
have
you
an
old
top
hat
on
you
dear
because
if
so
we'll
make
pudding
no
top
hat
then
pudding
is
horf
but
stay
who
is
this
approaching
can
it
be
say
mind
the
footlights
when
are
we
going
to
begin
there
said
thomas
proudly
anybody
would
know
that
was
blood
but
how
perfectly
lovely
said
myra
only
you
want
some
notches
what
for
to
show
where
you
executed
the
other
men
of
course
you
always
get
bit
off
your
axe
when
you
execute
anybody
yes
i've
noticed
that
too
agreed
notches
thomas
notches
why
don't
you
do
something
for
change
what
about
the
trap
or
whatever
it
is
you
catch
your
bally
rats
with
why
don't
you
make
that
it
isn't
done
with
trap
thomas
dear
it's
partly
the
power
of
the
human
eye
and
partly
kindness
sit
upon
sunny
bank
and
sing
to
them
which
is
that
if
we
don't
begin
soon
began
simpson
hallo
emperor
what's
that
you're
saying
quite
so
agree
with
you
wonder
if
your
high
fatness
can
lend
me
such
thing
as
hard-boiled
egg
simpkins
when
this
rehearsal
is
over
that
is
to
say
to-morrow
i'll
take
you
on
at
juggling
i'm
the
best
deny
finished
his
conversation
with
miss
fortescue
and
turned
to
the
stage
now
then
please
please
he
said
we'll
just
take
the
first
act
scene
the
emperor's
palace
enter
rat-catcher
you
come
on
from
the
left
coughed
and
came
on
my
part
was
not
long
one
but
it
was
very
important
one
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
different
episodes
of
the
play
and
they
wanted
some
connecting
whenever
anybody
came
on
to
the
stage
said
supposing
was
there
and
generally
was
the
rat-catcher
of
those
days
corresponding
to
the
modern
plumber
said
but
who
is
this
or
hush
here
comes
somebody
in
this
way
the
attention
of
the
wakeful
part
of
the
audience
was
switched
on
to
the
new
character
and
continuity
of
action
was
preserved
coughed
and
came
on
no
said
derry
you
must
come
on
much
more
briskly
can't
i've
been
bitten
by
rat
it
doesn't
say
so
anywhere
well
that's
how
read
the
part
hang
it
ought
to
know
if
i've
been
bitten
or
not
but
won't
show
it
if
you
like
i'll
come
on
briskly
went
out
and
came
on
very
briskly
that's
better
said
derry
his
majesty
ordered
me
to
be
here
at
the
stroke
of
noon
said
belike
he
has
some
secret
commands
to
lay
upon
me
or
perchance
it
is
nought
but
plague
of
rats
but
who
is
this
oh
said
myra
coming
in
suddenly
had
thought
to
be
alone
nay
do
not
flee
from
me
pretty
one
it
is
thus
that
say
myra
it's
no
good
my
saying
do
not
flee
if
you
don't
flee
was
just
going
to
you
didn't
give
me
chance
there
now
i'm
fleeing
oh
all
right
it
is
thus
that
the
rats
flee
when
they
see
me
approaching
am
so
very
fearsome
orrid
said
archie
to
himself
from
the
wings
one
moment
said
derry
and
he
turned
round
to
speak
to
somebody
puffickly
orrid
said
archie
again
nay
do
not
frown
myra
went
on
tis
only
my
little
brother
who
is
like
unto
codfish
himself
and
jealous
withal
ay
ay
and
thought
it
was
codfish
so
that
had
e'en
brought
the
egg-sauce
with
me
trouble
not
thyself
for
that
said
archie
for
verily
the
audience
will
supply
thee
with
all
the
eggs
thou
wantest
say
we
are
being
funny
i'm
not
i'm
quite
serious
really
did
think
it
was
co
but
tell
me
fair
one
said
hurriedly
for
what
dost
the
emperor
want
me
yes
yes
said
derry
i'm
sorry
had
to
interrupt
you
think
perhaps
we
had
better
begin
again
yes
from
the
beginning
the
rehearsal
rolled
on
think
it
went
splendidly
said
myra
if
only
we
had
known
our
parts
and
come
in
at
the
right
moments
and
been
more
serious
over
it
if
there's
any
laughing
to
be
done
it
will
have
to
be
done
by
us
the
audience
won't
laugh
mr
derry
having
explained
that
the
author
was
not
in
the
house
the
audience
collected
their
cauliflowers
and
left
quietly
think
it's
rotten
play
well
it
isn't
frightfully
funny
said
myra
but
we
can
put
that
in
ourselves
it's
so
jolly
hard
to
say
the
lines
properly
they're
so
unnatural
complained
thomas
truly
thou
hast
created
favourable
impression
with
the
damsel'
well
mean
it's
absurd
any
ordinary
person
would
say
truly
thou
art
amongst
them
old
spot
or
something
of
that
kind
well
you
say
that
thomas
you'll
be
all
right
we
might
put
few
songs
in
said
dahlia
and
dance
or
two
think
you've
forgotten
that
we've
done
only
act
remarked
archie
his
majesty's
conjuror
doesn't
really
let
himself
go
till
act
ii
still
i'm
all
for
song
and
dance
simpson
come
and
apache
with
me
they
dashed
at
each
other
fiercely
oh
we'll
make
it
go
all
right
said
myra
chapter
iv
last
moments
has
anybody
here
seen
kelly
asked
dahlia
putting
her
head
in
at
the
billiard-room
door

waiting
here

doesn't
matter
about
me
i'm
not
on
for
long
time
rat-catcher's

elaborate
one

about
five
minutes
it
is
now
seven-thirty
we
begin
at
eight-thirty
hence
the
billiard
cue
more
chalk
oh
why
aren't
you
nervous
how
you
can
stand
calmly

nervous
look
aimed
carefully
and
put
the
red
into
pocket
some
miles
away
there
you
are
have
you
ever
seen
me
do
that
in
real
life
of
course
not
if
my
hand
had
been
steady
should
have
been
foot
to
the
right
still
more
chalk
well
want
archie
and
shall
cry
if

find
him
that's
how
feel
she
sat
down
and
got
up
again
my
dear
dahlia
said
solemnly
now
you
can
understand
father's
feelings
mean
now
you
see
what
you
women
have
brought
on
yourselves
who
suggested
play
the
women
who
dragged
me
into
it
the
women
who
said
rat-catchers
always
wore
whiskers
the
women
who
is
designing
me
pair
of
whiskers
at
this
moment
the
wom
simpson
who
but
for
whom
this
is
going
to
be
very
difficult
sentence
who
but
for
whom
would
be
just
thinking
of
dressing
leisurely
for
dinner
instead
of
which
we
had
hasty
snack
and
have
now
got
to
put
on
heaven
knows
what
the
women
well
it
serves
you
right
don't
be
horrid
want
archie
she
got
up
for
the
third
time
and
drifted
out
of
the
room
chalked
my
cue
and
went
into
pocket
without
touching
anything
when
say
went
in
mean
that
the
ball
was
playing
with
went
in
you
do
see
that
very
well
then
took
it
out
and
began
to
squint
along
my
cue
again
when
two
hands
came
suddenly
over
my
eyes
and
voice
said
guess
who
is
is
the
queen
of
sheba
tried
right
said
myra
turned
and
looked
at
her
golly
you
do
you
really
do
said
at
last
did
they
always
dress
like
that
in
the
bong
era
short
skirts
long
pigtail
bare
arms
lovely
can
sit
in
the
sun
and
look
just
twenty-one
sang
myra
as
she
dropped
into
the
sofa
well
just
at
present
you're
sitting
in
the
billiard-room
and
looking
about
fifteen
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
french
this
term
had
very
bad
report
in
the
holidays
from
your
governess
the
extra
ninepence
week
seems
to
have
been
simply
thrown
away
aren't
you
excited
said
myra
looking
at
me
with
sparkling
eyes
as
for
calisthenics
well
what
say
is
my
daughter
is
church
of
england
and
if
you
don't
like
it
she
can
come
away
i'm
not
going
to
have
her
stuffed
up
with
all
that
nonsense
myra
jumped
up
aren't
you
excited
she
insisted
feel
my
tongue
mean
my
pulse
it's
quite
normal
and
why
because
i've
forgotten
my
part
and
i'm
going
to
bed
it's
great
responsibility
our
beginning
the
play
it
is
have
you
ever
thought
that
if
we
refused
to
begin
the
play
couldn't
continue
and
then
the
audience
would
be
able
to
go
home
my
idea
was
to
tackle
the
people
as
they
arrive
and
come
to
terms
with
them
i'm
sure
there's
money
in
it
you
aren't
bothering
are
you
of
course
am
i'd
give
hundred
pounds
to
be
out
of
it
no
wouldn't
i'd
give
hundred
pounds
if
you'd
always
wear
that
frock
and
do
your
hair
like
that
will
you
and
you
shall
go
on
with
your
french
child
myra
curtsied
prettily
and
i'll
go
on
with
my
whiskers
you
haven't
seen
me
in
those
yet
have
you
there
was
loud
noise
without
here
they
are
coming
in
it
was
not
the
whiskers
however
but
archie
and
thomas
in
full
costume
archie
in
green
and
thomas
in
black
hallo
said
archie
feel
just
like
conjuror
you
look
just
like
grasshopper
said
thomas
my
dear
friend
said
archie
patting
him
kindly
on
his
shoulder
is
that
you
but
you
oughtn't
to
be
here
you
know
you
came
up
the
hot-water
pipe
suppose
yes
yes
but
they
misdirected
you
the
blackbeetle
department
is
in
the
basement
well
well
it
will
be
easier
going
down
archie
dahlia's
looking
for
you
it's
all
right
she
found
me
she
was
nearly
in
tears
she
said
is
that
my
archibald
or
an
onion
said
fear
not
fair
one
tis
but
the
early
crocus
myra
don't
you
think
they've
overdone
the
green
rather
to
be
quite
frank
don't
see
why
conjuror
should
be
dressed
in
green
at
all
to
distinguish
him
from
the
rat-catcher
in
brown
the
executioner
in
black
and
the
master
of
the
gold
fish
in
red
had
thought
that
perhaps
certain
aptitude
for
legerdemain
might
so
distinguish
him
but
perceive
that
am
wrong
hallo
why
aren't
you
in
brown
then
i'm
coming
on
like
this
explained
was
going
to
have
changed
but
now
i've
seen
you
two
don't
think
will
with
my
ordinary
clothes
one
whisker
probably
the
starboard
one
and
little
insouciance
shall
be
great
success
what
annoys
me
said
thomas
is
that
in
the
early
bong
age
they
had
no
bally
pockets
i've
simply
got
nowhere
to
keep
handkerchief
keep
it
behind
the
scenes
and
then
if
you
blow
your
nose
immediately
before
the
execution
and
again
immediately
after
it
you
ought
to
be
all
right
it
isn't
for
that
it's
in
case
want
to
cry
it's
all
right
for
me
said
archie
i've
simply
got
to
say
now
can
anybody
in
the
audience
oblige
me
with
handkerchief
and
shall
get
dozens
then
shall
probably
touch
you
for
one
great
irvings
is
this
really
simpson
the
emperor
bong
was
making
splendid
entry
looking
except
for
his
spectacles
exactly
like
an
emperor
rise
rise
he
said
stop
grovelling
oh
look
here
you
fellows
when
say
on
the
stomach
then
you
must
oh
beg
your
pardon
miss
mannering
didn't
see
you
were
there
where
are
my
whiskers
asked
sternly
my
dear
old
chap
couldn't
do
them
there
wasn't
enough
to
go
round
made
two
nice
little
eyebrows
instead
you'll
find
them
on
your
dressing-table
oh
am
the
emperor
bong
am
beautiful
clever
and
strong
am
beauti
do
you
think
ought
to
wear
my
spectacles
or
not
there
was
loud
shout
of
no
oh
all
right
but
shall
probably
fall
over
the
sunset
or
something
thomas
if
you
see
me
wandering
into
new
moon
tap
me
on
the
head
with
your
axe
why
isn't
my
rat-catcher
dressed
he
was
waiting
for
his
whiskers
that's
perfectly
absurd
you
could
have
grown
pair
in
the
time
go
and
dress
at
once
refuse
to
do
anything
till
quarter-past
eight
said
if
get
into
my
things
now
all
the
atmosphere
will
have
worn
off
by
the
time
we
begin
it's
worn
off
me
long
time
ago
said
thomas
dismally
and
me
said
myra
with
shiver
well
we're
all
very
miserable
said
archie
let's
have
bottle
of
something
what
oh
hush
simpson
just
ring
the
bell
and
i'll
show
you
little
conjuring
trick
there's
nothing
on
the
table
at
present
is
there
no
well
now
you
watch
chapter
the
night
the
play
was
great
success
know
because
many
of
the
audience
told
me
so
afterwards
had
they
but
guessed
what
was
going
on
behind
the
scenes
the
congratulations
would
have
been
even
more
enthusiastic
for
as
near
as
touch
we
had
to
drop
the
eggproof
curtain
and
hand
the
money
back
am
going
to
give
you
the
opening
scene
as
it
was
actually
said
not
as
it
was
heard
across
the
footlights
and
then
you
will
understand
as
you
may
remember
the
rat-catcher
me
and
the
maid
myra
take
the
stage
first
and
they
introduce
themselves
in
the
usual
way
to
the
audience
and
each
other
the
scene
is
the
palace
of
the
emperor
bong
simpson
very
well
then
maid
sweetly
truly
his
majesty
is
handsome
man
and
wonder
not
that
his
people
love
him
rat-catcher
rather
nervous
thou
surprisest
me
saw
him
in
the
wings
in
the
winter
garden
just
now
that
is
to
say
anon
and
thought
him
plain
but
hush
here
he
comes
they
salaam
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
stay
there
rat-catcher
still
salaaming
what's
the
silly
ass
waiting
for
can't
stick
this
much
longer
the
blood's
all
going
to
my
head
like
anything
maid
in
similar
position
he
must
have
forgotten
his
cue
can't
you
say
hush
here
he
comes
again
rat-catcher
can't
say
anything

archie

she
is
dear
dahlia
whispered
to
me
how
you
can
go
on
it
was
simpson
who
saved
the
situation
and
made
us
merry
and
bright
again
he
hastily
trotted
out
the
suggestion
that
we
should
tour
the
country
in
the
summer
playing
cricket
in
the
day
and
bong
the
second
at
night
archie
backed
him
up
at
once
only
i'm
off
bong
two
altogether
he
said
of
course
what
we
want
is
cricket
play
we
shall
have
to
write
one
ourselves
expect
there
aren't
any
really
good
ones
about
act
rupert
vavasour
dashing
bat
and
the
last
descendant
of
an
ancient
but
impoverished
house
is
in
love
with
the
beautiful
but
equally
impoverished
millicent
milly
is
being
pursued
by
rich
villain
of
the
name
of
jasper
fordyce
the
said
jasper
being
bowler
of
extreme
swiftness
with
qualification
for
essex
go
on
simpson
in
order
to
restore
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
house
rupert
plays
for
kent
as
professional
binks
and
secures
talent
money
in
six
successive
matches
jasper
hears
of
it
and
act
ii
assassinates
the
scorer
bribing
hireling
of
his
own
to
take
the
deceased's
place
in
the
next
match
rupert
only
scores
forty-nine
rupert
continued
thomas
who
had
been
counting
his
own
jolly
score
and
made
it
eighty-seven
was
furious
and
determined
at
all
costs
to
foil
the
villain
accordingly
he
went
on
to
bowl
in
the
next
innings
and
took
five
wickets
for
two
hundred
and
thirty-nine
thus
obtaining
talent
money
little
love
interest
please
dahlia
said
archie
now
the
captain
who
was
in
the
secret
said
dahlia
was
in
love
with
rupert's
sister
which
was
why
he
put
binks
on
to
bowl
as
soon
as
binks
had
collected
his
five
wickets
blythe
went
on
and
took
the
other
five
for
three
runs
in
this
way
kent
just
managed
to
win
and
so
rupert
got
more
talent
money
the
next
match
was
against
essex
act
iii
the
great
act
of
the
play
and
jasper
fordyce
was
playing
for
the
leyton
brigade
as
he
put
on
his
spurs
before
taking
the
field
and
brushed
his
sleek
black
hair
he
smiled
sardonically
to
himself
had
he
not
overnight
dug
holes
in
the
pitch
at
the
pavilion
end
and
was
not
the
wicket
fiery
and
he
notoriously
an
erratic
bowler
everything
points
to
simpson
playing
jasper
said
and
continued
heads
cried
jasper
it
was
heads
put
you
in
he
remarked
calmly
what
said
the
other
in
amazement
ten
minutes
later
binks
and
humphreys
were
at
the
wicket
binks
took
first
ball
with
touch
of
nervousness
at
his
heart
all
depended
on
this
match
if
only
he
could
make
four
hundred
and
fifty
to-day
he
would
be
able
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
marry
his
millicent
play
jasper
rushed
up
to
the
wicket
and
delivered
the
ball
then
before
anybody
could
see
how
it
happened
rupert
was
stretched
full-length
upon
the
sward
had
rather
thought
of
playing
rupert
myself
said
archie
but
i'm
not
so
sure
now
five
for
two
hundred
and
thirty-nine
reminded
him
the
part
was
written
for
you
but
what
of
millicent
said
myra
fearing
lest
some
evil
should
overtake
her
lover
she
had
attended
the
match
clad
in
long
ulster
and
now
she
flung
this
off
revealing
the
fact
that
she
was
in
flannels
with
her
hair
tucked
up
beneath
her
county
cap
she
looked
slim
and
handsome
boy
to
rush
on
to
the
field
and
take
the
injured
one's
place
was
the
work
of
moment
who
is
this
said
the
umpires
in
amazement
fear
not
whispered
millicent
to
humphreys
have
birth
qualification
for
the
county
and
the
gardener
coached
me
for
an
hour
last
night
once
more
jasper
rushed
up
to
the
crease
and
the
spectators
held
their
breath
i'm
going
to
be
spectator
said
with
breath-holding
part
sorry
go
on
blair
then
millicent's
bat
flashed
and
behold
the
ball
was
on
the
boundary
torrent
of
cheers
rent
the
air
again
he
bowled
again
the
bat
flashed
jasper
ground
his
teeth
the
curtain
goes
down
here
to
represent
the
passing
of
an
hour
when
it
rises
again
millicent's
score
is
four
hundred
and
twenty-three
there
was
dead
silence
for
moment
then
millicent
swung
her
bat
and
at
that
the
cheers
broke
out
such
cheering
as
had
never
been
heard
before
maclaren's
record
score
was
beaten
at
last
now
surely
he
will
knock
his
wickets
down
said
the
spectators
little
did
they
know
that
until
four
hundred
and
fifty
was
upon
the
tins
the
mortgage
could
not
be
paid
off
four
hundred
and
thirty
four
hundred
and
forty
four
hundred
and
forty-nine
sharply
run
single
four
hundred
and
fifty
from
the
pavilion
rupert
heard
the
cheers
and
fainted
again
it
was
over
and
millicent
had
the
bowling
jasper
delivered
the
ball
fast
half-volley
oh
simpson
simply
must
play
jasper
and
millicent
drove
it
back
hard
and
true
jasper
tried
to
duck
but
it
was
too
late
he
was
dead
act
iv
all
his
money
went
to
rupert
who
was
distant
cousin
he
married
millicent
and
they
lived
happily
ever
after
but
though
they
are
always
to
be
seen
at
the
tonbridge
and
canterbury
weeks
they
have
never
played
cricket
again
curtain
and
bedtime
said
myra
suddenly
good-night
everybody
margery
to
margery
from
her
uncle
my
dear
margery
when
heard
that
you
really
had
arrived
got
out
the
broken
tea-cup
filled
it
at
the
bath
and
drank
to
my
niece
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
possible
had
been
on
the
stage
should
then
have
hurled
the
cup
over
my
shoulder
and
later
on
the
scene-shifter
would
have
come
and
collected
the
bits
as
it
was
left
that
part
out
and
you
will
forgive
me
will
you
not
dear
baby
when
you
hear
that
it
was
your
uncle's
last
cup
and
he
in
bad
way
financially
personally
was
all
for
coming
to
see
you
at
once
but
you
wrote
that
you
would
prefer
me
to
postpone
my
visit
for
week
at
the
end
of
which
time
you
would
have
settled
down
and
should
be
more
in
position
to
do
you
justice
the
critic
rather
than
the
mere
reporter
don't
know
if
those
were
quite
your
words
but
that
at
any
rate
was
the
idea
so
baby
here
am
week
later
and
just
returned
from
seeing
you
what
you
wish
to
know
were
my
impressions
it
is
like
your
cool
way
asking
me
what
think
of
you
it
was
you
who
were
to
have
been
interviewed
by
me
you
were
stranger
one
short
week
on
our
shores
and
wanted
to
ask
you
what
you
thought
of
the
english
ladies
what
were
your
views
on
our
climate
and
above
all
what
was
your
opinion
of
the
english
press
my
editor
had
heard
of
your
landing
and
those
were
the
things
he
wished
to
know
well
shall
say
that
your
views
were
undecided
two
kicks
cry
and
something
very
like
sneeze
you
haven't
quite
got
the
hang
of
our
language
yet
you
know
margery
there
was
at
one
time
some
talk
of
your
being
boy
and
in
that
case
your
father
and
had
decided
that
you
were
to
play
for
kent
was
to
have
bowled
to
you
every
evening
and
he
would
have
stood
by
and
said
you
should
have
come
forward
to
that
one
sir
at
the
public
schools
they
call
this
coaching
however
that
dream
is
over
now
and
the
most
we
can
hope
for
is
that
you
should
marry
someone
in
the
eleven
your
father
and
were
discussing
it
last
night
in
front
of
you
oh
what
would
mrs
grundy
say
and
we
had
almost
fixed
on
woolley
but
your
mother
objected
because
he
was
professional
trivial
reason
dear
margery
but
you
know
what
women
are
you
gave
little
cry
just
at
that
moment
and
know
you
meant
well
why
not
mr
hutchings
then
well
we
had
thought
of
him
only
your
mother
says
he
will
be
too
old
do
hope
baby
that
when
you
grow
up
you
will
be
guided
by
what
your
heart
says
and
not
by
what
your
mother
says
your
mother
think
you
must
be
careful
in
your
dealings
with
that
woman
above
all
do
not
let
her
prejudice
you
against
your
uncle
at
one
time
yesterday
we
were
discussing
your
personal
features
her
grannie's
mouth
said
somebody
her
father's
nose
volunteered
another
look
at
the
darling's
eyes
just
like
her
loving
mummy's
was
that
shameless
person's
own
contribution
then
in
haste
but
say
what
about
her
uncle
margery
your
mother
looked
at
you
thoughtfully
she
looked
at
you
every
way
and
then
suddenly
in
triumph
she
cried
why
nurse
of
course
her
uncle's
hair
they
tell
me
margery
that
as
matter
of
fact
your
name
is
marjorie
and
they
say
that
the
other
reminds
them
too
much
of
margarine
that
just
shows
how
ignorant
they
are
looked
up
margarine
in
the
dictionary
and
it
is
called
so
because
of
its
pearly
lustre
if
that
isn't
good
enough
for
them
they
must
be
very
proud
couple
anyhow
you
are
margery
to
me
hope
have
mind
above
your
commonplace
marjories
there
are
many
things
that
have
to
say
to
you
but
feel
quite
sure
that
your
mother
reads
your
letters
so
perhaps
had
better
wait
till
can
see
you
alone
want
you
always
to
insist
on
wearing
shoes
as
little
girl
and
not
those
ghastly
thirty-nine
button
boots
also
on
going
to
one
of
the
very
big
schools
if
you
go
to
boarding
school
at
all
and
want
but
must
talk
to
your
father
about
it
like
to
think
he
is
still
my
ally
time
was
when
he
too
knew
all
about
the
bringing
up
of
children
and
though
he
has
handicapped
himself
by
marrying
yet
now
and
then
when
we
are
alone
together
he
is
almost
sensible
on
the
subject
good-bye
give
my
love
to
your
mother
perhaps
we
can
trust
her
more
than
we
thought
after
all
ever
your
loving
uncle
to
her
uncle
from
margery
my
dear
uncle
thank
you
for
your
letter
was
just
as
glad
when
they
told
me
about
you
and
said
to
myself
must
be
very
nice
to
him
because
mother
and
have
been
here
for
years
and
years
simply
and
he's
quite
new
and
it's
unkind
of
you
to
say
kicked
was
only
stretching
and
one
must
stretch
or
one
will
never
grow
heard
nurse
tell
mother
that
and
you
know
you'd
like
to
have
tall
niece
think
shall
like
you
if
you're
sure
you
won't
mind
my
being
only
girl
don't
think
father
minds
although
he
looks
very
sad
about
something
every
now
and
then
he
came
back
late
from
the
office
the
other
day
and
mother
told
me
he'd
done
such
lot
of
work
and
was
so
tired
and
cried
all
night
about
it
was
so
sorry
for
him
mother
is
funny
person
this
morning
did
my
trick
of
opening
one
eye
and
keeping
the
other
shut
and
she
got
fearfully
excited
and
called
out
nurse
nurse
what's
the
matter
with
baby
she
can't
open
one
of
her
eyes
and
then
simply
had
to
open
it
so
as
could
wink
at
nurse
to
show
her
what
silly
mother
we
had
but
have
given
up
my
other
joke
of
pretending
to
be
dead
used
to
do
it
every
night
and
she
would
creep
out
of
bed
and
come
and
listen
at
my
cradle
and
well
i'm
only
girl
and
shall
never
go
to
public
school
but
still
know
when
joke
ceases
to
be
joke
and
becomes
bad
form
so
have
given
it
up
oh
talking
of
bad
form
some
chemists
who
had
read
about
me
in
the
papers
sent
me
sample
of
tooth
powder
in
rather
doubtful
taste
thought
want
you
to
come
and
see
me
have
my
bath
mother
asks
all
her
friends
so
why
shouldn't
ask
mine
of
course
would
rather
keep
it
private
but
if
mother
is
going
to
make
show
of
it
we
may
as
well
have
the
right
people
there
do
you
know
uncle
they
actually
do
it
in
basin
although
there's
proper
bath
just
next
door
know
i'm
small
but
is
it
quite
fair
always
to
be
harping
on
the
fact
twice
day
if
you
will
believe
me
of
course
mother
and
nurse
are
only
women
and
they
wouldn't
understand
this
but
am
sure
you
uncle
would
be
more
careful
of
people's
feelings
am
sorry
dear
but
don't
think
shall
be
able
to
marry
either
mr
hutchings
or
mr
woolley
you
see
they
are
rather
old
for
me
aren't
they
mother
told
me
yesterday
that
there
is
dear
little
boy
of
four
or
five
playing
about
somewhere
who
will
come
for
me
one
day
and
take
me
right
away
from
her
and
father
fancy
what
fun
about
my
name
well
i'm
afraid
it
will
have
to
be
marjorie
after
all
of
course
should
prefer
it
to
be
margery
but
mother
assures
me
that
the
owner
of
the
name
is
never
consulted
so
can't
say
anything
but
will
always
be
margery
to
you
and
we
won't
say
anything
more
about
it
to
the
others
do
you
see
dear
and
now
must
say
good-bye
as
mother
says
want
to
go
to
sleep
she
is
writing
this
for
me
and
some
of
the
things
she
didn't
want
to
say
at
all
but
threatened
her
with
my
joke
and
then
she
did
but
we
both
send
our
love
your
affectionate
niece
margery
was
weighed
yesterday
weigh
quite
lot
of
pounds
come
to-morrow
at
four
and
will
show
you
my
toes
margery's
sock
chapter
when
margery
was
three
months
old
wrote
letter
to
her
mother
dear
madam
if
you
have
copy
in
class
at
net
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
am
the
baby's
uncle
on
tuesday
got
an
answer
by
the
morning
post
dear
sir
in
reply
to
yours
how
dare
you
insult
my
child
she
is
in
class
priceless
and
bought
in
by
the
owner
four
months
old
and
two
days
on
christmas
day
fancy
am
the
baby's
mother
margery
had
been
getting
into
an
expensive
way
of
celebrating
her
birthday
every
week
hitherto
had
ignored
it
but
now
wrote
dear
madam
automatically
your
baby
should
be
in
class
by
now
cannot
understand
why
it
is
not
so
perhaps
shall
hear
from
you
later
on
with
regard
to
this
meanwhile
think
that
the
extraordinary
coincidence
all
but
two
days
of
the
baby's
birthday
with
christmas
day
calls
for
some
recognition
on
my
part
what
would
margery
like
you
who
are
in
constant
communication
with
her
should
be
able
to
tell
me
hear
coral
necklaces
well
spoken
of
what
do
you
think
remember
reading
once
of
robber
who
killed
little
baby
for
the
coral
on
its
neck'
which
shows
at
any
rate
that
they
are
worn
do
you
know
how
coral
reefs
are
made
it
is
most
fascinating
business
then
there
is
silver
mug
to
be
considered
the
only
thing
you
can
drink
out
of
mug
is
beer
yet
it
is
popular
present
perhaps
you
with
your
supposed
greater
knowledge
of
babies
will
explain
this
meanwhile
am
the
baby's
uncle
which
is
much
finer
thing
than
mother
to
which
her
mother
my
dear
boy
it
is
too
sweet
of
you
to
say
you
would
like
to
get
baby
something
no
don't
know
how
coral
reefs
are
made
and
don't
want
to
think
it
is
wicked
of
you
to
talk
like
that
i'm
sure
sha'n't
dare
to
let
her
wear
anything
valuable
now
and
don't
think
she
really
wants
mug
i'm
sure
don't
know
what
she
does
want
except
to
see
her
uncle
there
but
it
ought
to
be
something
that
she'll
value
when
she
grows
up
and
of
course
we
could
keep
it
for
her
in
the
meantime
her
father
has
smoked
his
last
cigar
to-day
isn't
it
awful
have
forbidden
him
to
waste
his
money
on
any
more
but
he
says
he
must
give
me
five
hundred
for
christmas
present
if
he
does
shall
give
him
that
sideboard
that
want
so
badly
and
then
we
shall
both
go
to
prison
together
you
will
look
after
baby
won't
you
am
the
baby's
mother
which
she
isn't
proud
but
does
think
it's
little
bit
classier
than
an
uncle
and
so
finally
dear
child
i've
thought
of
the
very
thing
am
the
baby's
uncle
that
ends
chapter
here
we
go
on
to
chapter
ii
chapter
ii
finds
me
in
the
toy
department
of
the
stores
want
said
present
for
child
yes
sir
about
how
old
it
must
be
quite
new
said
sternly
don't
be
silly
oh
see
well
the
child
is
only
baby
ah
yes
now
here
if
it's
at
all
fond
of
animals
say
you
mustn't
call
it
it
get
in
an
awful
row
if
do
of
course
suppose
it's
all
right
for
you
only
well
be
careful
won't
you
the
attendant
promised
and
asked
whether
the
child
was
boy
or
girl
and
had
you
thought
of
anything
for
the
little
girl
well
yes
had
rather
thought
of
sideboard
beg
your
pardon
sideboard
the
sideboard
department
is
upstairs
was
there
anything
else
for
the
little
girl
well
box
of
cigars
rather
full
and
if
you
have
any
the
cigar
department
is
on
the
ground
floor
but
your
lord
chamberlain
told
me
was
to
come
here
if
wanted
present
for
child
if
you
require
anything
in
the
toy
line
yes
but
what
good
are
toys
to
baby
of
four
months
do
be
reasonable
what
was
it
you
suggested
sideboard
and
cigar
that
was
my
idea
it
may
not
be
the
best
possible
but
at
least
it
is
better
than
perfectly
useless
toys
you
can
always
blow
smoke
in
its
face
or
bump
its
head
against
the
sideboard
experto
crede
if
you
have
the
latin
whereupon
with
great
dignity
made
my
way
to
the
lift
in
the
sideboard
department
said
want
sideboard
for
little
girl
of
four
months
and
please
don't
call
her
it
nearly
had
row
with
one
of
your
downstairs
staff
about
that
will
try
to
be
careful
sir
he
replied
what
sort
of
one
blue
eyes
and
not
much
hair
and
really
rather
sweet
smile
was
that
what
you
wanted
to
know
thank
you
sir
but
meant
what
sort
of
sideboard
took
him
confidentially
by
the
arm
look
here
said
you
know
how
when
one
is
carrying
baby
about
one
bumps
its
head
on
all
the
corners
well
not
too
much
of
that
the
mothers
don't
really
like
it
you
know
they
smile
at
the
time
but
well
not
too
many
corners
yes
like
that
very
much
no
won't
take
it
with
me
the
attendant
wrote
out
the
bill
number
sir
she's
the
first
that's
why
i'm
so
nervous
i've
never
bought
sideboard
for
child
before
your
stores
number
mean
sir
haven't
got
one
is
it
necessary
must
have
number
sir
then
i'll
think
of
nice
one
for
you
let's
see
now
does
that
strike
you
and
the
name
oh
can't
tell
you
that
you
must
look
that
up
for
yourself
good-day
downstairs
bought
some
cigars
for
little
girl
of
four
months
said
and
she
likes
them
rather
full
please
don't
argue
with
me
all
your
men
chatter
so
must
said
the
attendant
it's
like
this
if
she
is
only
four
months
she
is
obviously
little
your
observation
is
therefore
tautological
as
matter
of
fact
said
hotly
she
is
rather
big
for
four
months
then
it
was
lie
look
here
you
give
me
those
cigars
and
don't
talk
so
much
i've
already
had
words
with
your
master
of
the
sideboards
and
your
under-secretary
for
the
toy
department
thank
you
if
you
would
kindly
send
them
chapter
iii
so
there
it
is
have
given
the
spirit
rather
than
the
actual
letter
of
what
happened
at
the
stores
but
that
the
things
have
been
ordered
there
is
no
doubt
and
when
margery
wakes
up
on
christmas
day
to
find
sideboard
and
box
of
cigars
in
her
sock
hope
she
will
remember
that
she
has
chiefly
her
mother
to
thank
for
it
how
to
play
the
pianola
foreword
margery
wishes
me
to
publish
the
following
correspondence
which
has
recently
passed
between
us
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
name
under
which
appear
in
it
may
perhaps
need
explanation
hate
explanations
but
here
it
is
when
margery
was
eight
months
old
she
was
taught
to
call
me
uncle
must
suppose
that
at
this
time
was
always
giving
her
things
things
she
really
wanted
such
as
bootlaces
the
best
china
evening
papers
and
so
on
which
had
been
withheld
by
those
in
authority
later
on
these
persons
came
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
gave
her
if
not
the
best
china
at
any
rate
cake
and
bread-and
butter
naturally
their
offerings
being
appreciated
at
last
were
greeted
with
the
familiar
cry
of
uncle
no
dear
not
uncle
thank-you'
came
the
correction
dear
thankyou
i've
some
wonderful
news
for
you
guess
what
it
is
but
no
you
never
will
well
i'll
tell
you
can
walk
really
and
really
it
is
most
awfully
interesting
you
put
one
foot
out
to
the
right
and
then
you
bring
the
left
after
it
that's
one
walk
and
have
done
seven
altogether
you
have
to
keep
your
hands
out
in
front
of
you
so
as
to
balance
properly
that's
all
the
rules
the
rest
is
just
knack
got
it
quite
suddenly
yesterday
it
is
such
fun
wake
up
about
five
every
morning
now
thinking
of
it
of
course
fall
down
now
and
then
you
see
i'm
only
beginning
when
fall
mother
comes
and
picks
me
up
that
reminds
me
don't
want
you
to
call
me
baby
any
more
now
can
walk
babies
can't
walk
they
just
get
carried
about
and
put
in
perambulators
was
given
lot
of
names
long
time
ago
but
forget
what
they
were
think
one
was
something
rather
silly
like
margery
but
have
never
had
it
used
lately
mother
always
calls
me
now
good-bye
write
directly
you
get
this
your
loving
ii
my
dear
was
so
glad
to
get
your
letter
because
was
just
going
to
write
to
you
what
do
you
think
no
you'll
never
guess
shall
tell
you
no
yes
no
well
i've
bought
pianola
it's
really
rather
difficult
to
play
it
properly
know
people
like
paderewski
and
can
only
think
of
paderewski
for
the
moment
know
that
sort
of
person
doesn't
think
much
of
the
pianola
artist
but
they
are
quite
wrong
about
it
all
the
mechanical
agility
with
the
fingers
is
nothing
the
soul
is
everything
now
you
can
get
the
soul
the
con
molto
expressione
feeling
just
as
well
in
the
pianola
as
in
the
piano
of
course
you
have
to
keep
sharp
eye
on
the
music
some
people
roll
it
off
just
like
barrel-organ
but
when
see
allegro
or
andante
or
anything
of
that
kind
on
the
score
i'm
on
it
like
bird
no
time
for
more
now
as
i've
just
got
new
lot
of
music
in
your
loving
thankyou
when
are
you
coming
to
hear
me
play
did
mumbling
mose
just
now
with
one
hand
and
lots
of
soul
signed
paderewski
am
glad
you
can
walk
iii
dear
thankyou
am
rather
upset
about
my
walking
you
remember
told
you
had
done
seven
in
my
last
well
this
morning
couldn't
do
single
one
well
did
do
one
as
matter
of
fact
but
suppose
some
people
would
say
it
didn't
count
because
fell
down
directly
after
though
don't
see
that
that
matters
do
you
thankyou
but
even
with
that
one
it
was
only
one
and
yet
know
did
seven
the
day
before
wonder
why
it
is
do
it
the
right
way
i'm
sure
and
keep
my
hands
out
so
as
to
balance
so
perhaps
it's
the
shoes
that
are
wrong
must
ask
mother
to
get
me
new
pair
and
tell
the
man
they're
for
walks
now
do
write
me
nice
long
letter
thankyou
because
feel
very
miserable
about
this
it
is
right
isn't
it
when
you
have
the
right
leg
out
only
to
bring
the
left
one
just
up
to
it
and
not
beyond
and
does
it
matter
which
foot
you
start
with
let
me
know
quickly
because
father
is
coming
home
to-morrow
and
want
to
show
him
your
loving
am
glad
you
like
your
pianola
iv
dear
very
glad
to
get
yours
if
you
really
want
long
letter
you
shall
have
one
only
warn
you
that
if
once
begin
nothing
less
than
an
earthquake
can
stop
me
well
first
then
played
the
merry
widow
waltz
yesterday
to
mrs
polacca
who
is
great
authority
on
music
and
in
with
all
the
queen's
hall
set
and
she
said
that
my
touch
reminded
her
of
i've
forgotten
the
man's
name
now
which
is
rather
sickening
because
it
spoils
the
story
bit
but
he
was
one
of
the
real
tip-toppers
who
make
hundreds
week
and
well
that
was
the
sort
of
man
reminded
her
of
if
can
do
that
with
waltz
it
stands
to
reason
that
with
something
classic
there'd
be
no
holding
me
think
shall
give
recital
tickets
no
free
seats
no
emergency
exit
it
is
great
mistake
to
have
an
emergency
exit
at
recital
three
pages
omitted
really
you
must
hear
me
doing
the
double
in
the
boston
cake
walk
to
get
me
at
my
best
you've
heard
kubelik
on
the
violin
well
it's
not
bit
like
that
and
yet
there's
just
that
something
which
links
great
artists
together
no
matter
what
their
medium
of
expression
your
loving
thankyou
glad
you're
getting
on
so
well
with
your
walking
dearest
thankyou
hooray
hooray
hooray
did
twenty-five
walks
to-day
father
counted
he
says
my
style
reminds
him
of
cancer
vulgaris
rather
how
many
times
can
he
do
it
not
twenty-five
on
the
third
day
i'm
sure
isn't
it
splendid
of
me
see
now
where
was
wrong
yesterday
got
the
knack
again
suddenly
this
morning
and
i'm
all
right
now
to-morrow
shall
walk
round
the
table
it
is
longish
way
and
there
are
four
turns
which
am
not
sure
about
how
do
you
turn
suppose
you
put
the
right
hand
out
your
very
loving
vi
dear
am
rather
hurt
by
your
letters
have
written
several
times
to
tell
you
all
about
my
new
pianola
and
you
don't
seem
to
take
any
interest
at
all
was
going
to
have
told
you
this
time
that
the
man
in
the
flat
below
has
sent
me
note
just
as
if
it
had
been
real
piano
he
says
he
doesn't
mind
my
playing
all
day
so
long
as
don't
start
before
eight
in
the
morning
as
he
is
in
his
bath
then
and
in
listening
to
the
music
quite
forgets
to
come
out
sometimes
which
can
see
might
be
very
awkward
write
to
yours
affectionately
thankyou
vii
darling
thankyou
am
so
sorry
dear
and
will
come
and
hear
your
pianola
to-morrow
and
think
it
lovely
and
you
must
be
clever
to
play
so
well
but
you
mustn't
be
angry
with
me
because
am
so
taken
up
with
my
walking
you
see
it
is
all
so
new
to
me
feel
as
though
want
everybody
to
know
all
about
it
your
pianola
must
be
lovely
thankyou
dear
thankyou
could
you
do
you
think
put
all
the
letters
we
wrote
to
each
other
about
my
walking
in
some
book
so
that
other
people
would
know
how
to
do
it
the
way
do
you
might
call
it
letters
on
walking
or
how
to
walk
or
but
you
could
get
better
title
than
could
do
your
very
loving
i'm
so
glad
about
the
pianola
and
do
you
mind
if
just
tell
you
that
did
walk
round
the
table
corners
and
all
viii
dearest
right
you
are
will
think
of
good
title
your
loving
thankyou
the
knight
of
the
chimney-piece
we
don't
know
his
real
name
but
we
have
decided
to
call
him
arthur
sir
arthur
suppose
he
would
be
he
stands
in
bronze
upon
the
chimney-piece
and
in
his
right
hand
is
javelin
this
makes
him
very
dangerous
person
opposite
him
but
behind
the
clock
coward
stands
the
other
fellow
similarly
armed
most
people
imagine
that
the
two
are
fighting
for
the
hand
of
the
lady
on
the
clock
and
they
aver
that
they
can
hear
her
heart
beating
with
the
excitement
of
it
but
to
let
you
into
the
secret
the
other
fellow
doesn't
come
into
the
story
at
all
only
margery
and
know
the
true
story
think
told
it
to
her
one
night
when
she
wouldn't
go
to
sleep
or
perhaps
she
told
it
to
me
the
best
of
this
tale
say
it
as
the
possible
author
is
that
it
is
modern
it
were
easy
to
have
invented
something
more
in
keeping
with
the
knight's
armour
but
we
had
to
remember
that
this
was
the
twentieth
century
and
that
here
in
this
twentieth
century
was
sir
arthur
on
the
chimney-piece
with
his
javelin
drawn
back
for
whom
is
he
waiting
it
all
began
said
year
ago
when
sir
arthur
became
member
of
the
south
african
chartered
incorporated
co-operative
stores
society
limited
ten
per
cents
at
par
men
only
he
wasn't
exactly
real
member
having
been
elected
under
rule
two
for
meritorious
performances
rule
one
being
that
this
club
shall
be
called
what
said
just
now
but
for
nearly
year
he
enjoyed
all
the
privileges
of
membership
including
those
of
paying
large
entrance
fee
and
still
larger
subscription
at
the
end
of
year
however
dreadful
thing
happened
they
made
third
rule
to
wit
that
no
member
should
go
to
sleep
on
the
billiard-table
of
course
sir
arthur
having
only
got
in
under
rule
two
had
to
resign
he
had
already
paid
his
large
entrance
fee
and
as
it
happened
his
second
year's
subscription
in
advance
naturally
he
was
annoyed
and
that
in
fact
is
why
he
stands
on
the
chimney-piece
with
his
javelin
drawn
back
he
is
waiting
for
the
secretary
sir
arthur
is
considered
to
be
good
shot
and
the
secretary
wants
all
the
flowers
to
be
white
at
this
point
margery
said
her
best
word
gorky
which
means
thousand
thanks
for
the
verisimilitude
of
your
charming
and
interesting
story
but
is
not
the
love
element
trifle
weak
margery
is
true
woman
we
must
leave
something
to
the
imagination
pleaded
the
secretary
no
doubt
had
delightful
niece
and
sir
arthur's
hopeless
passion
for
her
after
he
had
hit
her
uncle
in
vital
spot
would
be
the
basis
of
most
powerful
situation
margery
said
gorky
again
which
as
have
explained
means
are
such
distressing
situations
within
the
province
of
the
highest
art
when
margery
says
gorky
twice
in
one
night
it
is
useless
to
argue
gave
in
at
once
butter
said
placed
upon
the
haft
of
the
javelin
would
make
it
slip
and
put
him
off
his
shot
he
would
miss
the
secretary
and
marry
the
niece
so
we
put
good
deal
of
butter
on
sir
arthur
and
for
the
moment
the
secretary
is
safe
don't
know
if
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
it
there
but
in
case
jam
does
as
well
margery
has
promised
to
stroke
him
every
day
however
anticipate
as
soon
as
the
secretarial
life
was
saved
margery
said
agga
which
is
as
it
were
encore
or
bis
so
that
have
her
permission
to
tell
you
that
story
all
over
again
indeed
should
feel
quite
justified
in
doing
so
instead
will
give
you
the
tragedy
of
george
the
other
fellow
no
knight
he
as
she
told
it
to
me
afterwards
george
was
quite
different
man
from
sir
arthur
so
far
from
being
elected
to
anything
under
rule
two
he
got
blackballed
for
the
st
john's
wood
toilet
club
opinions
differed
as
to
why
this
happened
some
said
it
was
his
personal
unpopularity
he
had
previously
been
up
without
success
for
membership
of
the
local
ratepayers
association
others
among
them
the
proprietor
that
his
hair
grew
too
quickly
anyhow
it
was
great
shock
to
george
and
they
had
to
have
man
in
to
break
it
to
him
it's
always
the
way
when
you
have
man
in
george
was
stricken
to
the
heart
this
last
blow
was
too
much
for
what
had
always
been
proud
nature
he
decided
to
emigrate
accordingly
he
left
home
and
moved
to
kilburn
whether
he
is
still
there
or
not
cannot
say
but
card
with
that
postmark
reached
his
niece
only
this
week
it
was
unsigned
and
bore
on
the
space
reserved
for
inland
communications
these
words
the
old
old
wish
merry
christmas
and
happy
new
year
but
what
about
the
javelin
asked
margery
this
fellow
had
javelin
too
you
remember
gorky
said
margery
for
the
third
time
which
means
well
upon
my
word
don't
know
what
it
means
but
it
would
explain
it
all
meanwhile
sir
arthur
he
was
in
my
story
you
know
is
still
waiting
for
the
secretary
in
case
the
butter
gives
out
have
mentioned
that
the
secretary
wants
all
the
flowers
to
be
white
the
art
of
conversation
in
conversation
said
somebody
think
it
was
my
grandfather
there
should
always
be
give
and
take
the
ball
must
be
kept
rolling
if
he
had
ever
had
niece
two
years
old
don't
think
he
would
have
bothered
what's
at
said
margery
pointing
suddenly
that
said
stroking
it
is
dear
uncle's
nose
what's
at
take
your
finger
away
ah
yes
that
is
dear
uncle's
eye
the
left
one
dear
uncle's
left
one
said
margery
thoughtfully
what's
it
doing
thinking
what's
finking
what
dear
uncle
does
every
afternoon
after
lunch
what's
lunch
eggs
sardines
macaroons
everything
with
great
effort
margery
resisted
the
temptation
to
ask
what
everything
was
difficult
question
or
what
everything
was
doing
still
more
difficult
one
and
made
statement
of
her
own
santa
claus
bring
margie
balloon
from
daddy
she
announced
balloon
how
jolly
said
with
interest
what
sort
are
you
having
one
of
those
semi-detached
ones
with
the
gas
laid
on
or
the
pink
ones
with
velvet
collar
down
chimney
said
margery
oh
that
kind
do
you
think
mean
isn't
it
rather
tell
margie
story
about
balloon
bother
murmured
what's
bovver
bother
is
what
you
say
when
relations
ask
you
to
tell
them
story
about
balloon
it
means
but
for
the
fact
that
we
both
have
the
montmorency
blood
in
our
veins
should
be
compelled
to
decline
your
kind
invitation
all
the
stories
know
about
balloons
being
stiff
uns
it
also
means
instead
of
talking
about
balloons
won't
you
sing
me
little
song
nope
said
margery
bother
she's
forgotten
her
music
what
did
you
say
uncle
dear
what
did
you
say
sighed
and
began
once
upon
time
there
was
balloon
dear
little
toy
balloon
and
and
what's
at
asked
margery
making
dab
at
my
chest
what's
at
uncle
dear
that
said
is
button
more
particularly
red
waistcoat
button
more
particularly
still
my
top
red
waistcoat
button
what's
at
she
asked
going
down
one
that
is
button
description
second
red
waistcoat
parents
living
both
injections
diseases
scarlet
fever
slightly
once
what's
at
that's
ah
yes
button
the
third
good
little
chap
but
not
so
chubby
as
his
brothers
he
couldn't
go
down
to
margate
with
them
last
year
and
so
of
course
well
as
was
saying
there
was
once
balloon
and
what's
a-a
at
said
margery
bending
forward
suddenly
and
kissing
it
look
here
you've
jolly
well
got
to
enclose
stamped
addressed
envelope
with
the
next
question
as
matter
of
fact
though
you
won't
believe
me
that
again
is
button
what's
at
asked
margery
digging
at
the
fifth
button
owing
to
extreme
pressure
on
space
began
thank
you
that
also
is
button
its
responsibility
is
greater
than
that
of
its
brethren
the
crash
may
come
at
any
moment
luckily
it
has
booked
its
passage
to
the
where
was
oh
yes
well
this
balloon
what's
at
said
margery
pointing
to
the
last
one
must
have
written
notice
of
that
question
can't
tell
you
offhand
what's
at
uncle
dear
well
don't
know
margie
it
looks
something
like
collar
stud
only
somehow
you
wouldn't
expect
to
find
collar-stud
there
of
course
it
may
have
slipped
or
could
it
be
one
of
those
red
beads
do
you
think
n-no
no
it
isn't
bead
and
it
isn't
raspberry
because
this
is
the
wrong
week
for
raspberries
of
course
it
might
be
by
jove
i've
got
it
it's
button
gave
the
sort
of
war-whoop
with
which
one
announces
these
discoveries
and
margery
whooped
too
button
she
cried
dear
little
button
she
thought
for
moment
what's
button
this
was
ridiculous
you
don't
mean
to
say
reproached
her
that
i've
got
to
tell
you
now
what
button
is
that
added
severely
pointing
to
the
top
of
my
waistcoat
is
button
what's
at
said
margery
pointing
to
the
next
one
looked
at
her
in
horror
then
began
to
talk
very
quickly
there
was
once
balloon
said
rapidly
dear
little
boy
balloon
mean
toy
balloon
and
this
balloon
was
jolly
little
balloon
just
two
minutes
old
and
he
wasn't
always
asking
silly
questions
and
when
he
fell
down
and
exploded
himself
they
used
to
wring
him
out
and
say
come
come
now
be
little
airship
about
it
and
so
what's
at
asked
margery
pointing
to
the
top
button
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
began
to
sing
carol
in
very
shrill
voice
all
the
artist
rose
in
margery
don't
sing
she
said
hurriedly
margie
sing
what
will
margie
sing
uncle
before
could
suggest
anything
she
was
off
it
was
scandalous
song
she
began
by
announcing
that
she
wanted
to
be
among
the
boys
and
guessing
that
should
object
assured
me
that
it
was
no
good
kicking
up
noise
because
it
was
no
fun
going
out
when
there
weren't
any
boys
about
you
were
so
lonely-onely
onely
here
the
tune
became
undecided
and
chance
word
recalling
another
context
to
her
mind
she
drifted
suddenly
into
hymn
and
sang
it
with
the
same
religious
fervour
as
she
had
sung
the
other
her
fair
head
flung
back
and
her
hazel
eyes
gazing
into
heaven
listened
carefully
this
was
bit
didn't
recognise
the
tune
wavered
for
moment
and
out
of
it
these
words
emerged
triumphant
talk
of
me
to
the
boys
you
meet
remember
me
kindly
to
regent
street
and
give
them
my
love
in
the
what's
at
uncle
that
said
stroking
it
is
dear
uncle's
nose
what's
by
the
way
would
you
like
it
all
over
again
no
oh
very
well
afternoon
sleep
in
the
afternoon
they
came
unto
land
in
which
it
seemed
always
afternoon
am
like
napoleon
in
that
can
go
to
sleep
at
any
moment
am
unlike
him
believe
in
that
am
always
doing
so
one
makes
no
apology
for
doing
so
on
sunday
afternoon
the
apology
indeed
should
come
from
the
others
the
wakeful
parties
uncle
margery
will
you
come
and
play
wiv
me
i'm
rather
busy
just
now
said
with
closed
eyes
after
tea
why
are
you
raver
busy
just
now
my
baby's
only
raver
busy
sometimes
well
then
you
know
what
it's
like
how
important
it
is
that
one
shouldn't
be
disturbed
but
you
must
be
beturbed
when
ask
you
to
come
and
play
wiv
me
oh
well
what
shall
we
play
at
trains
said
margery
eagerly
when
we
play
trains
have
to
be
tunnel
don't
know
if
you
have
ever
been
tunnel
no
well
it's
an
over-rated
profession
we
won't
play
trains
announced
firmly
because
it's
sunday
why
not

talk
to

highly
respected

margery
said
solemnly
oh
see
that's
right
now
then
what
about
going
to
sleep
she
was
silent
for
moment
and
thought
was
safe
then
uncle
just
tell
me
why
was
at
little
boy
crying
vis
morning
which
little
boy
ve
one
in
road
oh
that
one
well
he
was
crying
because
his
uncle
hadn't
had
any
sleep
all
night
and
when
he
tried
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
afternoon
say
prehaps
again
my
first
rejected
contribution
sighed
and
had
another
shot
well
then
said
gallantly
it
must
have
been
because
he
hadn't
got
sweet
little
girl
of
three
to
play
with
him
yes
said
margery
nodding
her
head
thoughtfully
at
was
it
to
jock
on
choosing
profession
when
jock
saw
you
debonair
and
bland
shin
perilously
up
the
cottage
grand
piano
with
the
bread-knife
in
your
hand
when
observed
your
friendly
little
stare
your
guileless
baby
face
your
general
air
of
golly
how
on
earth
did
get
there
when
remarked
how
cheerfully
you
crashed
down
on
the
tea-things
not
the
least
abashed
to
see
the
same
my
wedding
present
smashed
then
as
we
wondered
having
wiped
the
tea
from
off
this
waistcoat
what's
he
going
to
be
knew
at
once
why
father
thought
the
sea
there
are
who
sit
and
languidly
dictate
letters
beginning
yours
of
even
date
each
one
designed
to
rope
in
six-and
eight
wherefore
each
letter
carefully
postpones
the
moment
when
the
other
party
owns
his
case
is
badly
dished
by
rex
jones
there
are
who
daily
in
the
safe
retreat
of
some
department
gather
round
and
bleat
scandal
and
art
until
it's
time
to
eat
return
at
three
and
having
written
dear
sir
your
communication
of
last
year
duly
received
and
noted
disappear
there
are
who
do
not
hesitate
to
shove
their
views
of
babes
and
budgets
life
and
love
on
paper
as
it
might
be
up
above
who
fearless
fellows
are
not
found
to
flinch
when
some
proprietor
essays
to
pinch
their
holiest
thoughts
at
eightpence
for
the
inch
such
jock
as
these
are
we
who
bear
your
name
content
well
almost
with
the
good
old
game
of
moderate
fortune
unrelieved
by
fame
but
there
are
nobler
souls
about
the
place
such
spirits
as
have
built
our
island
race
heroes
who
must
who
simply
must
have
space
twas
not
to
serve
the
pen
that
nature
gave
to
these
their
love
of
all
that's
large
and
brave
for
them
an
ampler
life
upon
the
wave
so
when
your
father
while
mop
the
tea
says
that
he
rather
thinks
you'll
go
to
sea
dear
jock
sweet
jock
your
uncle
must
agree
more
cricket
to
an
old
bat
when
vesper
trails
her
gown
of
grey
across
the
lawn
at
six
or
seven
the
diligent
observer
may
or
may
see
athwart
the
heaven
an
aimless
rodent
on
the
wing
well
that
is
probably
bat
in
any
case
shall
not
sing
of
that
willow
in
our
hours
of
ease
that
is
to
say
throughout
the
winter
take
you
sometimes
on
my
knees
and
careless
of
the
frequent
splinter
caress
you
tenderly
and
sigh
and
say
ye
gods
how
long
till
may
and
so
as
soon
as
april's
here
do
not
sob
for
spring
to
show
its
pale
daffodils
and
all
the
dear
old
flowers
that
keep
the
minor
poets
sing
it
just
because
month
about
will
find
you
fairly
out
revered
beloved
you
whose
job
is
but
to
serve
throughout
the
season
to
make
if
so
it
be
the
blob
and
not
thank
heaven
to
ask
the
reason
to
stand
like
mrs
hemans'
little
friend
undoubting
to
the
end
old
willow
what
tale
to
tell
our
steady
rise
from
small
beginnings
ab
ovo
usque
usque
well
to
eighty-four
our
highest
innings
ah
me
that
crowded
hour
of
glorious
lives
ten
of
them
all
from
drives
once
only
have
you
let
me
in
through
all
the
knocks
we've
had
together
that
time
when
wanting
four
to
win
fairly
tried
to
tonk
the
leather
and
lo
full-faced
welt
without
the
least
warning
went
painful
scene
in
point
of
fact
i'm
doubtful
if
ought
to
hymn
it
enough
to
say
you
went
and
cracked
and
left
me
thinking
things
like
dimmit
and
not
like
dimmit
as
heard
slip
call
mine
and
he
pouched
the
ball
do
you
remember
too
the
game
one
august
somewhere
down
in
dorset
when
being
told
to
force
the
same
we
straightway
started
in
to
force
it
for
half-an
hour
or
so
we
saw
it
through
and
scratched
priceless
two
or
how
the
prayer
to
play
for
keeps
and
hang
the
runs
we
didn't
need
em
so
stirred
us
we
collected
heaps
with
rather
more
than
usual
freedom
fifteen
in
fourteen
minutes
till
catch
abruptly
closed
the
match
well
well
the
coming
years
if
fine
shall
see
us
going
even
stronger
so
pouring
out
the
oil
and
wine
let's
sit
and
drink
little
longer
here's
to
decent
average
of
ten
yours
is
the
oil
say
when
when
morning
on
the
heels
of
night
picks
up
her
shroud
at
five
and
after
the
diffident
observer
might
or
might
not
see
beneath
rafter
pensive
rodent
upside
down
well
that
is
possibly
bat
in
any
case
have
not
sung
of
that
scratch
lot
the
choosing
of
the
day
as
soon
as
had
promised
to
take
an
eleven
down
to
chartleigh
knew
that
was
in
for
trouble
but
did
not
realise
how
great
it
would
be
until
consulted
henry
barton
henry
is
first-class
cricketer
and
it
was
my
idea
that
he
should
do
all
the
batting
for
us
and
such
of
the
bowling
as
the
laws
allowed
had
also
another
idea
and
this
explained
to
henry
as
you
are
aware
said
the
ideal
side
contains
five
good
bats
four
good
bowlers
wicket-keeper
and
henry
barton
quite
so
agreed
henry
that
is
the
principle
on
which
one
selects
an
eleven
now
intend
to
strike
out
line
of
my
own
my
team
shall
consist
of
three
authors
or
journalists
two
solicitors
four
barristers
couple
from
the
stock
exchange
some
civil
servants
and
an
artist
or
two
how
many
is
that
nineteen
well
that's
the
idea
anyhow
it's
rotten
idea
no
it's
splendid
idea
wonder
nobody
has
thought
of
it
before
send
solicitor
and
journalist
in
first
the
journalist
uses
the
long
handle
while
the
solicitor
plays
for
keeps
and
where
does
the
artist
come
in
the
artist
comes
in
last
and
plays
for
draw
you
are
very
slow
to-day
henry
henry
the
man
of
leisure
thought
moment
yes
that's
all
very
well
for
you
working
men
he
said
at
last
but
what
do
go
as
or
am
one
of
the
barristers
you
go
as
with
barton
yes
if
you're
very
good
you
shall
have
an
in
brackets
after
you
with
barton
the
method
of
choosing
my
team
being
settled
the
next
thing
was
the
day
any
day
in
the
first
week
in
july
the
chartleigh
captain
had
said
now
at
first
sight
there
appear
to
be
seven
days
in
the
week
but
it
is
not
really
so
for
instance
saturday
now
there's
good
day
what
could
one
object
to
in
saturday
but
do
you
imagine
henry
barton
would
let
it
pass
don't
think
you'll
get
eleven
people
for
the
saturday
he
said
people
are
always
playing
cricket
on
saturday
precisely
said
healthy
exercise
for
the
london
toiler
that's
why
i'm
asking
em
but
mean
they'll
have
arranged
to
play
already
with
their
own
teams
or
else
they'll
be
going
away
for
week-ends
one
can
spend
very
pretty
week-end
at
chartleigh
h'm
let
me
think
any
day
in
the
week
isn't
it
except
apparently
saturday
said
huffily
let's
see
now
what
days
are
there
mentioned
two
or
three
of
the
better-known
ones
yes
of
course
some
of
those
are
impossible
though
we'd
better
go
through
the
week
and
see
which
is
best
don't
know
who
barton
is
that
he
should
take
it
upon
himself
to
make
invidious
distinctions
between
the
days
of
the
week
very
well
then
said
sunday
ass
that
seemed
to
settle
sunday
so
we
passed
on
to
monday
you
won't
get
your
stockbroker
on
monday
said
henry
it's
contanger
day
or
something
with
them
every
monday
stocktaking
don't
you
mean
dare
say
anyhow
no
one
in
the
house
can
get
away
on
monday
must
have
my
stockbrokers
tuesday
tuesday
it
seemed
was
hopeless
was
fool
to
have
thought
of
tuesday
why
everybody
knew
that
tuesday
was
an
impossible
day
for
forget
what
spoilt
tuesday's
chance
fancy
it
was
busy
day
for
civil
servants
no
one
in
the
home
civil
can
get
away
on
tuesday
know
that
sounds
absurd
but
henry
was
being
absurd
just
then
or
was
it
barristers
briefs
get
given
out
on
tuesday
was
made
to
understand
that
brought
us
to
wednesday
hoped
much
from
wednesday
yes
said
henry
wednesday
might
do
of
course
most
of
the
weeklies
go
to
press
on
wednesday
rather
an
awkward
day
for
journalists
what
about
thursday
began
to
get
annoyed
thursday
my
flannel
trousers
go
to
the
press
said
that
is
to
say
they
come
back
from
the
wash
then
look
here
why
try
to
be
funny
hang
it
who
started
it
talking
about
contanger-days
contanger
it
sounds
like
new
kind
of
guano
well
if
you
don't
believe
me
henry
do
thursday
be
it
then
yes
suppose
that's
all
right
said
henry
doubtfully
why
not
don't
say
it's
sending-in
day
with
artists
implored
not
every
thursday
no
only
there's
friday
and
friday
is
my
busy
day
pleaded
my
one
ewe
lamb
do
not
rob
me
of
it
it's
very
good
day
friday
think
you'd
find
that
most
people
could
get
off
then
but
why
throw
over
thursday
like
this
good
honest
day
henry
many
people
get
born
on
thursday
henry
and
it's
marrying
day
henry
nice
clean
sober
day
and
you
the
fact
is
said
henry
i've
suddenly
remembered
i'm
engaged
myself
on
thursday
this
was
too
much
henry
said
coldly
you
forget
yourself
you
forget
yourself
strangely
my
lad
just
because
was
weak
enough
to
promise
you
an
after
your
name
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
the
was
to
be
in
brackets
yes
but
i'm
afraid
really
am
engaged
are
you
really
look
here
i'll
leave
out
the
with'
and
you
shall
be
one
of
us
there
baby
see
the
pretty
gentlemen
henry
smiled
and
shook
his
head
oh
well
said
we
must
have
you
so
if
you
say
friday
friday
it
is
you're
quite
sure
friday
is
all
right
for
solicitors
very
well
then
so
the
day
was
settled
for
friday
it
was
rather
pity
because
as
said
in
the
ordinary
way
friday
is
the
day
put
aside
for
work
ii
the
selection
committee
the
committee
consisted
of
henry
and
myself
originally
it
was
myself
alone
but
as
soon
as
had
selected
henry
proceeded
to
co-opt
him
reserving
to
myself
however
the
right
of
casting
vote
in
case
of
any
difference
of
opinion
one
arose
almost
immediately
over
higgins
henry
said
that
higgins
had
once
made
ninety-seven
that
he
had
been
asked
to
play
for
his
county
that
he
was
an
artist
and
we
had
arranged
to
have
an
artist
in
the
team
in
reply
pointed
out
that
ninety-seven
was
an
extremely
unlikely
number
for
anyone
to
have
made
that
if
he
had
been
asked
he
evidently
hadn't
accepted
which
showed
the
sort
of
man
he
was
besides
which
what
was
his
county
that
assuming
for
the
moment
he
had
made
ninety-seven
was
it
likely
he
would
consent
to
go
in
last
and
play
for
draw
which
was
why
we
wanted
the
artist
and
that
anyhow
he
was
jolly
bad
artist
that
hadn't
we
better
put
it
to
the
vote
this
was
accordingly
done
and
an
exciting
division
ended
in
tie
those
in
favour
of
higgins
those
against
higgins
the
speaker
gave
his
casting
vote
against
higgins
prior
to
this
however
had
laid
before
the
house
the
letter
of
invitation
it
was
as
follows
and
flatter
myself
combined
tact
with
certain
dignity
dear
am
taking
team
into
the
country
on
friday
week
to
play
against
the
village
eleven
the
ground
and
the
lunch
are
good
do
you
think
you
could
manage
to
come
down
know
you
are
very
busy
just
now
with
contangers
briefs
clients
your
christmas
number
varnishing
day
strike
out
all
but
one
of
these
but
day
in
the
country
would
do
you
good
hear
from
all
sides
that
you
are
in
great
form
this
season
will
give
you
all
particulars
about
trains
later
on
good-bye
remember
me
to
how
is
ever
yours
old
henry
is
playing
for
us
he
has
strained
himself
little
and
probably
won't
bowl
much
so
expect
we
shall
all
have
turn
with
the
ball
or
don't
think
you
have
ever
met
henry
barton
the
cricketer
he
is
very
keen
on
meeting
you
apparently
he
has
seen
you
play
somewhere
he
will
be
turning
out
for
us
on
friday
we
might
manage
to
have
some
bridge
in
the
train
that
said
to
henry
is
what
call
clever
letter
what
makes
you
think
that
it
is
all
clever
said
modestly
but
the
cleverest
part
is
sentence
at
the
end
will
give
you
all
particulars
about
trains
later
on
you
see
have
been
looking
them
up
and
we
leave
victoria
at
seven-thirty
and
get
back
to
london
bridge
at
eleven-forty
five
the
answers
began
to
come
in
the
next
day
one
of
the
first
was
from
bolton
the
solicitor
and
it
upset
us
altogether
for
after
accepting
the
invitation
he
went
on
am
afraid
don't
play
bridge
as
you
may
remember
used
to
play
chess
at
cambridge
and
still
keep
it
up
chess
said
henry
that's
where
white
plays
and
mates
in
two
moves
and
there's
black
too
he
does
something
we
shall
have
to
get
black
this
is
awful
perhaps
bolton
would
like
to
do
problems
by
himself
all
the
time
that
would
be
rather
bad
luck
on
him
no
look
here
here's
carey
glad
to
come
but
doesn't
bridge
he's
the
man
accordingly
we
wired
to
carey
do
you
play
chess
reply
at
once
he
answered
no
why
carey
will
have
to
play
that
game
with
glass
balls
solitaire
yes
we
must
remember
to
bring
board
with
us
but
what
about
the
chess
gentleman
asked
henry
must
go
and
find
one
we've
had
one
refusal
there
is
an
editor
know
slightly
so
called
upon
him
at
his
office
found
him
writing
verses
be
brief
he
said
i'm
frightfully
busy
have
just
three
questions
to
ask
you
replied
what
rhymes
with
yorker'
that
wasn't
one
of
them
yorker
corker
por
better
make
it
full
pitch
suggested
step
out
and
make
it
full
pitch
then
there
are
such
lots
of
rhymes
thanks
will
well
one
do
you
play
bridge
no
two
do
you
play
chess
can
three
do
you
play
cricket
not
that
it
matters
yes
do
sometimes
good-bye
send
me
proof
will
you
by
the
way
what
paper
is
this
for
the
sportsman
if
you'll
play
on
friday
week
do
anything
if
you'll
go
may
have
that
in
writing
he
handed
me
rejection
form
there
you
are
and
i'll
do
anything
you
like
on
friday
went
back
to
henry
and
told
him
the
good
news
wonder
if
he'll
mind
being
black
said
henry
that's
the
chap
that
always
gets
mated
so
quickly
expect
they'll
arrange
it
among
themselves
anyhow
we've
done
our
best
for
them
it's
an
awful
business
getting
up
team
said
henry
thoughtfully
well
we
shall
have
two
decent
sets
of
bridge
anyway
but
you
ought
to
have
arranged
for
twelve
aside
and
then
we
could
have
left
out
the
chess
professors
and
had
three
sets
it's
all
the
fault
of
the
rules
some
day
somebody
will
realise
that
four
doesn't
go
into
eleven
and
then
we
shall
have
new
rule
no
don't
think
so
said
henry
don't
fancy
wanderer'
would
allow
it
iii
in
the
train
if
there
is
one
thing
cannot
stand
it
is
ingratitude
take
the
case
of
carey
carey
you
may
remember
professed
himself
unable
to
play
either
bridge
or
chess
and
as
we
had
three-hour
journey
before
us
it
did
not
look
as
though
he
were
going
to
have
much
of
time
however
henry
and
thinking
entirely
of
carey's
personal
comfort
went
to
the
trouble
of
buying
him
solitaire
board
with
glass
balls
complete
the
balls
were
all
in
different
colours
laid
this
before
carey
as
soon
as
we
settled
in
the
train
whatever's
that
the
new
game
said
it's
all
the
rage
now
the
man
tells
me
the
smart
set
play
it
every
sunday
young
girls
are
inveigled
into
lonely
country
houses
and
robbed
of
incredible
sums
carey
laughed
scornfully
so
it
is
alleged
added
the
inventor
claims
for
it
that
in
some
respects
it
has
advantages
which
even
cricket
cannot
claim
as
for
instance
it
can
be
played
in
any
weather
nay
even
upon
the
sick
bed
and
how
exactly
is
it
played
thus
you
take
one
away
and
all
the
rest
jump
over
each
other
at
each
jump
you
remove
the
jumpee
and
the
object
is
to
clear
the
board
hence
the
name
solitaire
see
it
seems
pretty
rotten
game
that
made
me
angry
all
right
then
don't
play
have
game
of
marbles
on
the
rack
instead
meanwhile
henry
was
introducing
bolton
and
the
editor
to
each
other
two
such
famous
people
he
began
everyone
said
bolton
with
bow
knows
the
editor
of
oh
yes
there's
that
but
meant
two
such
famous
chess
players
bolton
he
explained
to
the
editor
was
twelfth
man
against
oxford
some
years
ago
something
went
wrong
with
his
heart
or
he'd
have
got
in
on
his
day
and
if
the
board
was
at
all
sticky
he
used
to
turn
good
deal
from
qb
do
you
really
play
asked
bolton
eagerly
have
board
here
does
he
play
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
never
heard
of
the
trocadero
defence
the
sicilian
defence
the
trocadero
defence
it's
where
you
palm
the
other
man's
queen
when
he's
not
looking
most
effective
opening
they
both
seemed
keen
on
beginning
so
henry
got
out
the
cards
for
the
rest
of
us
drew
the
younger
journalist
against
henry
and
the
senior
stockbroker
out
of
compliment
to
the
journalist
we
arranged
to
play
half-a
crown
hundred
that
being
about
the
price
they
pay
him
dealt
and
problem
arose
immediately
here
it
is
deals
and
leaves
it
to
his
partner
who
goes
no
trumps
leads
small
heart
b's
hand
consists
of
king
and
three
small
diamonds
king
and
one
other
heart
king
and
three
small
clubs
and
three
small
spades
plays
the
king
from
dummy
and
puts
on
the
ace
what
should
do
answer
ring
communication-cord
and
ask
guard
to
remove
very
well
said
to
dummy
one
thing's
pretty
clear
you
don't
bowl
to-day
long-leg
both
ends
is
about
your
mark
somewhere
where
there's
plenty
of
throwing
to
do
later
on
when
was
dummy
strolled
over
to
the
chess
players
what's
the
ground
like
said
the
editor
as
he
finessed
knight
sporting
distinctly
sporting
long
grass
all
round
suppose
oh
lord
no
the
cows
eat
up
all
that
do
you
mean
to
say
the
cows
are
allowed
on
the
pitch
well
they
don't
put
it
that
way
quite
the
pitch
is
allowed
on
the
cows'
pasture
land
suppose
if
we
make
hundred
we
shall
do
well
asked
somebody
if
we
make
fifty
we
shall
declare
said
by
jove
bolton
that's
pretty
smart
move
may
not
know
all
the
technical
terms
but
do
understand
the
idea
of
chess
the
editor
was
pawn
up
and
three
to
play
and
had
just
advanced
his
queen
against
bolton's
king
putting
on
lot
of
check
side
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
course
expected
bolton
would
have
to
retire
his
king
but
not
he
he
laid
stymie
with
his
bishop
and
it
was
the
editor's
queen
that
had
to
withdraw
yet
bolton
was
only
spare
man
at
cambridge
am
not
at
all
sure
said
that
chess
is
not
finer
game
even
than
solitaire
it's
finer
game
than
cricket
said
bolton
putting
his
bishop
back
in
the
slips
again
no
said
the
editor
cricket
is
the
finest
game
in
the
world
for
why
will
tell
you
thanks
to
the
glorious
uncertainty
of
our
national
pastime
began
the
journalist
from
his
next
monday's
article
no
thanks
to
the
fact
that
it
is
game
in
which
one
can
produce
the
maximum
of
effect
with
the
minimum
of
skill
take
my
own
case
am
not
batsman
shall
never
make
ten
runs
in
an
innings
yet
how
few
people
realise
that
go
in
first
wicket
down
wearing
my
cap
having
taken
guard
with
the
help
of
bail
adopt
palairet's
stance
at
the
wicket
then
the
bowler
delivers
either
to
the
off
to
leg
or
straight
if
it
is
to
the
off
shoulder
my
bat
and
sneer
at
it
if
it
is
to
leg
swing
at
it
have
beautiful
swing
which
is
alone
worth
the
money
probably
miss
but
the
bowler
fully
understands
that
it
is
because
have
not
yet
got
the
pace
of
the
wicket
sooner
or
later
he
sends
down
straight
one
whereupon
proceed
to
glide
it
to
leg
you
will
see
the
stroke
in
beldam's
book
of
course
miss
the
ball
and
am
given
out
then
the
look
of
astonishment
that
passes
over
my
face
the
bewildered
inquiry
of
the
wicket-keeper
and
finally
the
shrug
of
good-humoured
resignation
as
walk
from
the
crease
nine
times
out
of
ten
square-leg
asks
the
umpire
what
county
play
for
that
is
cricket
quite
so
said
when
he
had
finished
there's
only
one
flaw
in
it
that
is
that
quite
possibly
you
may
have
to
go
in
last
to-day
you'll
have
to
think
of
some
other
plan
also
on
this
wicket
the
ball
always
goes
well
over
your
head
you
couldn't
be
if
you
tried
oh
but
do
try
yes
well
you'll
find
it
difficult
the
editor
sighed
then
shall
have
to
retire
hurt
he
said
bolton
chuckled
to
himself
one
never
retires
hurt
at
chess
he
said
as
he
huffed
the
editor's
king
though
once
he
added
proudly
sprained
my
hand
and
had
to
make
all
my
moves
with
the
left
one
check
the
editor
yawned
and
looked
out
of
the
window
are
we
nearly
there
he
asked
iv
in
the
field
it
is
consider
the
duty
of
captain
to
consult
the
wishes
of
his
team
now
and
then
particularly
when
he
is
in
command
of
such
heterogeneous
collection
of
the
professions
as
was
was
watching
match
at
the
oval
once
and
at
the
end
of
an
over
lees
went
up
to
dalmeny
and
had
few
words
with
him
probably
thought
he
is
telling
him
good
story
that
he
heard
at
lunch
or
maybe
he
is
asking
for
the
latest
gossip
from
the
lobby
my
neighbour
however
held
other
views
there
he
said
there's
ole
walter
lees
asking
to
be
took
off
surely
not
answered
dalmeny
had
telegram
just
now
and
lees
is
asking
if
it's
the
three-thirty
winner
lees
then
began
to
bowl
again
there
you
are
said
triumphantly
but
my
neighbour
wouldn't
hear
of
it
ole
lees
asked
to
be
took
off
and
ole
dalmeny
forget
how
he
pronounced
it
but
know
it
was
one
of
the
wrong
ways
ole
dalmeny
told
him
he'd
have
to
stick
on
bit
now
that
made
great
impression
on
me
and
agreed
with
my
friend
that
dalmeny
was
in
the
wrong
when
am
captaining
team
said
and
one
of
the
bowlers
wants
to
come
off
am
always
ready
to
meet
him
half-way
more
than
half-way
better
than
that
if
have
resolved
upon
any
course
of
action
always
let
my
team
know
beforehand
and
listen
to
their
objections
in
fair-minded
spirit
it
was
in
accordance
with
this
rule
of
mine
that
said
casually
as
we
were
changing
if
we
win
the
toss
shall
put
them
in
there
was
chorus
of
protest
that's
right
go
it
said
henry
objects
because
as
first-class
cricketer
he
is
afraid
of
what
the
sportsman
will
say
if
we
lose
the
editor
naturally
objects
it
ruins
his
chance
of
being
mistaken
for
county
player
if
he
has
to
field
first
bolton
objects
because
heavy
exercise
on
hot
day
spoils
his
lunch
thompson
objects
because
that's
the
way
he
earns
his
living
at
the
bar
his
objection
is
merely
technical
and
is
reserved
as
point
of
law
for
the
court
of
crown
cases
reserved
markham
is
socialist
and
objects
to
authority
also
he
knows
he's
got
to
field
long-leg
both
ends
gerald
but
why
said
henry
because
want
you
all
to
see
the
wicket
first
then
you
can't
say
you
weren't
warned
whereupon
went
out
and
lost
the
toss
as
we
walked
into
the
field
the
editor
told
me
very
funny
story
cannot
repeat
it
here
for
various
reasons
first
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
cricket
and
secondly
it
is
understand
coming
out
in
his
next
number
and
should
probably
get
into
trouble
also
it
is
highly
technical
and
depends
largely
for
its
success
upon
adequate
facial
expression
but
it
amused
me
good
deal
just
as
he
got
to
the
exciting
part
thompson
came
up
do
you
mind
if
go
cover
he
asked
do
said
abstractedly
and
what
did
the
vicar
say
the
editor
chuckled
well
you
see
the
vicar
knowing
of
course
that
cover
suppose
said
gerald
as
he
caught
us
up
what
oh
yes
please
the
vicar
did
know
did
he
oh
the
vicar
knew
that's
really
the
whole
point
shouted
with
laughter
good
isn't
it
said
the
editor
well
then
have
you
got
cover
came
markham's
voice
from
behind
us
turned
round
oh
markham
said
shall
want
you
cover
if
you
don't
mind
sorry
must
tell
these
men
where
to
go
well
then
you
were
saying
the
editor
continued
the
story
we
were
interrupted
once
or
twice
but
he
finished
it
just
as
their
first
two
men
came
out
particularly
liked
that
bit
about
the
jove
said
suddenly
we
haven't
got
wicket-keeper
that's
always
the
way
can
you
keep
asked
the
editor
isn't
there
anyone
else
i'm
afraid
they're
all
fielding
cover
said
remembering
suddenly
but
look
here
it's
the
chance
of
lifetime
for
you
you
can
tell
em
all
that
but
he
was
trotting
off
to
the
pavilion
can
anybody
lend
me
some
gloves
he
asked
they
want
me
to
keep
wicket
thing
i've
never
done
in
my
life
of
course
always
field
cover
in
the
ordinary
way
thanks
awfully
sure
you
don't
mind
don't
suppose
shall
stop
ball
though
henry
called
you're
starting
that
end
arrange
the
field
will
you
i'll
go
cover
you're
sure
to
want
one
their
first
batsman
was
an
old
weather-beaten
villager
called
george
we
knew
his
name
was
george
because
the
second
ball
struck
him
in
the
stomach
and
his
partner
said
stay
there
george
which
seemed
to
be
george's
idea
too
we
learnt
at
lunch
that
once
in
the
eighties
or
so
he
had
gone
in
first
with
lord
hawke
which
put
him
on
level
with
that
player
and
that
he
had
taken
first
ball
which
put
him
just
above
the
yorkshireman
there
the
story
ended
so
far
as
george
was
concerned
and
indeed
it
was
enough
why
seek
to
inquire
if
george
took
any
other
balls
besides
the
first
in
our
match
however
he
took
the
second
in
the
place
that
mentioned
the
third
on
the
back
of
the
neck
the
fourth
on
the
elbow
and
the
fifth
in
the
original
place
while
the
sixth
being
off
the
wicket
was
left
there
nearly
every
batsman
had
some
pet
stroke
and
we
soon
saw
that
george's
stroke
was
the
leg-bye
his
bat
was
the
second
line
of
defence
and
was
kept
well
in
the
block
if
the
ball
escaped
the
earthwork
in
front
there
was
always
chance
that
it
would
be
brought
up
by
the
bat
once
indeed
splendid
ball
of
henry's
which
came
with
his
arm
and
missed
george's
legs
snicked
the
bat
and
went
straight
into
the
wicket-keeper's
hands
the
editor
however
presented
his
compliments
and
regretted
that
he
was
unable
to
accept
the
enclosed
which
he
accordingly
returned
with
many
thanks
there
was
an
unwritten
law
that
george
could
not
be
cannot
say
how
it
arose
possibly
from
natural
coyness
on
george's
part
about
the
exact
significance
of
the
henry
after
appealing
for
the
best
part
of
three
overs
gave
it
up
and
bowled
what
he
called
googlies
at
him
this
looked
more
hopeful
because
googly
seems
in
no
way
to
be
restricted
as
to
the
number
of
its
bounces
and
at
each
bounce
it
had
chance
of
doing
something
unfortunately
it
never
did
george
lunch
came
and
the
score
was
thirty-seven
george
having
compiled
in
two
hours
masterly
nineteen
eighteen
off
the
person
but
none
the
less
directly
due
to
him
we
must
think
of
plan
of
campaign
at
lunch
said
henry
it's
hopeless
to
go
on
like
this
does
george
drink
asked
anxiously
it
seemed
the
only
chance
but
george
didn't
and
the
score
was
thirty
seven
for
five
which
is
good
score
for
the
wicket
at
the
wickets
at
lunch
said
have
just
had
wire
from
the
surrey
committee
to
say
that
may
put
myself
on
to
bowl
that
is
good
hearing
said
henry
did
they
hear
asked
gerald
anxiously
looking
over
at
the
chartleigh
team
you
may
think
you're
very
funny
but
i'll
bet
you
anything
you
like
that
get
george
out
all
right
said
gerald
i'll
play
you
for
second
wicket
down
the
loser
to
go
in
last
done
said
and
what
about
passing
the
salad
now
after
lunch
the
editor
took
me
on
one
side
and
said
don't
like
it
don't
like
it
at
all
then
why
did
you
have
so
much
asked
mean
the
wicket
it's
dangerous
am
not
thinking
of
myself
so
much
as
of
as
of
the
reading
public
quite
so
you
think
you
you
would
be
missed
in
fleet
street
just
at
first
you
are
not
putting
the
facts
too
strongly
was
about
to
suggest
that
should
be
did
not
bat
oh
see
perhaps
ought
to
tell
you
that
was
talking
just
now
to
the
sister
of
their
captain
the
editor
looked
interested
about
the
pad
of
the
gardener
he
said
about
you
she
said
give
you
her
own
words
who
is
the
tall
handsome
man
keeping
wicket
in
cap
so
said
you
were
well-known
county
player
as
she
would
see
when
you
went
in
to
bat
the
editor
shook
my
hand
impressively
thank
you
very
much
he
said
shall
not
fail
her
what
county
did
you
say
part
of
flint
you
know
the
little
bit
that's
got
into
the
wrong
county
by
mistake
that
part
she
had
never
heard
of
it
but
assured
her
it
had
little
bit
of
yellow
all
to
itself
on
the
map
have
you
pretty
good
eleven
the
editor
swore
twice
once
for
me
and
once
for
flint
then
we
went
out
into
the
field
my
first
ball
did
for
george
followed
the
tactics
of
william
the
first
at
the
battle
of
hastings
you
remember
how
he
ordered
his
archers
to
shoot
into
the
air
and
how
one
arrow
fell
and
pierced
the
eye
of
harold
whereupon
confusion
and
disaster
arose
so
with
george
hurled
one
perpendicularly
into
the
sky
and
it
dropped
after
long
time
straight
upon
the
batsman
george
followed
it
with
slightly
contemptuous
eye
all
the
way
all
the
way
of
course
was
sorry
we
were
all
much
distressed
they
told
us
afterwards
he
had
never
been
hit
in
the
eye
before
one
gets
new
experiences
george
retired
hurt
not
so
much
hurt
as
piqued
fancy
he
told
the
umpire
it
wasn't
bowling
possibly
neither
was
it
batting
it
was
just
superior
tactics
the
innings
soon
closed
and
we
had
sixty-one
to
win
and
what
seemed
more
likely
fifty-nine
and
various
other
numbers
to
lose
sixty-one
is
very
unlucky
number
with
me
oddly
enough
have
never
yet
made
sixty-one
like
grace
who
had
never
made
ninety-three
my
average
this
season
is
five
which
is
respectable
number
as
bolton
pointed
out
if
we
each
got
five
to-day
and
there
were
six
extras
we
should
win
suppose
if
one
plays
chess
good
deal
one
thinks
of
these
things
harold
mean
george
refused
to
field
so
nobly
put
myself
in
last
and
substituted
for
him
this
was
owing
to
an
argument
as
to
the
exact
wording
of
my
bet
with
gerald
you
said
you'd
get
him
out
said
gerald
mean
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
field
out
of
meant
out'
according
to
the
laws
of
cricket
there
are
nine
ways
which
was
yours
should
like
to
know
obstructing
the
ball
there
you
are
shifted
my
ground
didn't
say
i'd
get
him
out
explained
said
i'd
get
him
those
were
my
very
words
will
get
george
can
you
deny
that
got
him
even
if
you
said
that
which
you
didn't
the
common
construction
that
one
puts
upon
the
phrase
is
if
you
are
going
to
use
long
words
like
that
said
must
refer
you
to
my
solicitor
bolton
whereupon
bolton
took
counsel's
opinion
and
reported
that
he
could
not
advise
me
to
proceed
in
the
matter
so
gerald
took
second
wicket
and
fielded
however
one
advantage
of
fielding
was
that
saw
the
editor's
innings
from
start
to
finish
at
the
closest
quarters
he
came
in
at
the
end
of
the
first
over
and
took
guard
for
left
hand
round
the
wicket
would
you
give
it
me
he
said
to
bolton
these
country
umpires
thanks
and
what's
that
over
the
wicket
thanks
he
marked
two
places
with
the
bail
how
about
having
it
from
here
suggested
at
mid-on
it's
quite
good
place
and
we're
in
straight
line
with
the
church
the
editor
returned
the
bail
and
held
up
his
bat
again
that
one-leg'
all
right
thanks
he
was
proceeding
to
look
round
the
field
when
gentle
voice
from
behind
him
said
if
you
wouldn't
mind
moving
bit
sir
could
bowl
oh
is
it
over
said
the
editor
airily
trying
to
hide
his
confusion
beg
your
pardon
beg
your
pardon
still
he
had
certainly
impressed
the
sister
of
their
captain
and
it
was
dreadful
to
think
of
the
disillusionment
that
might
follow
at
any
moment
however
as
it
happened
he
had
yet
another
trick
up
his
sleeve
bolton
hit
ball
to
cover
and
the
editor
in
the
words
of
the
local
paper
most
sportingly
sacrificed
his
wicket
when
he
saw
that
his
partner
had
not
time
to
get
back
it
was
question
however
whether
there
was
ever
run
possible
which
shows
that
the
reporter
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
their
captain's
sister
when
came
in
the
score
was
fifty-one
for
nine
and
henry
was
still
in
had
only
one
ball
to
play
so
feel
that
should
describe
it
in
full
have
four
good
scoring
strokes
the
cut
the
drive
the
hook
and
the
glance
as
the
bowler
ran
up
to
the
crease
decided
to
cut
the
ball
to
the
ropes
directly
however
it
left
his
hand
saw
that
it
was
ball
to
hook
and
accordingly
changed
my
attitude
to
the
one
usually
adopted
for
that
stroke
but
the
ball
came
up
farther
than
expected
so
at
the
last
moment
drove
it
hard
past
the
bowler
that
at
least
was
the
idea
actually
it
turned
out
to
be
beautiful
glance
shot
to
the
leg
boundary
seldom
if
ever
has
beldam
had
such
an
opportunity
for
four
action
photographs
on
one
plate
henry
took
sixer
next
ball
and
so
we
won
and
the
rest
of
the
story
of
my
team
is
it
not
written
in
the
journals
of
the
sportsman
and
the
chartleigh
watchman
and
in
the
hearts
of
all
who
were
privileged
to
compose
it
but
how
the
editor
took
two
jokes
told
him
in
the
train
and
put
them
in
his
paper
as
his
own
and
how
carey
challenged
the
engine-driver
to
an
eighteen-hole
solitaire
match
and
how
these
things
indeed
shall
never
be
divulged
ex
nihilo
fit
multum
should
like
to
explain
just
what
happened
to
the
ball
in
the
first
place
it
was
of
an
irreproachable
length
and
broke
very
sharply
and
cleverly
from
the
leg
the
bowler
am
sure
will
bear
me
out
in
this
also
it
rose
with
great
suddenness
and
before
had
time
to
perfect
any
adequate
system
of
defence
took
me
on
the
knee
and
from
there
rolled
on
to
the
off-stump
there
was
considerable
amount
of
applause
on
the
part
of
the
field
due
no
doubt
to
the
feeling
that
dangerous
batsman
had
been
dismissed
without
scoring
need
hardly
add
that
did
not
resent
this
appreciation
what
really
wished
to
say
to
the
wicket-keeper
was
that
it
was
the
first
fast
wicket
had
played
on
this
summer
that
it
was
my
first
nought
this
season
and
hang
it
even
fry
made
noughts
sometimes
and
that
personally
always
felt
that
it
didn't
matter
what
one
made
oneself
so
long
as
one's
side
was
victorious
what
actually
said
was
shorter
but
expect
the
wicket-keeper
understood
just
as
well
he
seemed
an
intelligent
fellow
after
that
walked
nine
miles
back
to
the
pavilion
the
next
man
was
brushing
his
hair
in
the
dressing-room
what's
happened
he
asked
nothing
said
truthfully
but
you're
out
aren't
you
mean
that
nothing
has
eventuated
accrued
as
it
were
blob
bad
luck
is
my
parting
straight
it
curls
bit
from
leg
up
at
the
top
but
it
will
do
mind
you
make
some
always
feel
that
so
long
as
one's
side
is
victorious
but
he
was
gone
brushed
my
own
hair
very
carefully
lit
cigarette
and
went
outside
to
the
others
always
think
that
nought
itself
is
nothing
the
way
one
carries
it
off
is
everything
disaster
not
only
to
himself
but
also
to
his
side
should
not
make
man
indifferent
to
his
personal
appearance
bad
luck
said
somebody
did
it
come
back
very
quickly
we
both
did
he
wasn't
breaking
much
when
was
in
said
some
tactless
idiot
then
why
did
you
get
out
retorted
moved
quickly
away
from
him
and
sat
next
to
man
who
had
yet
to
go
in
bad
luck
he
said
second
ball
wasn't
it
expect
shall
do
the
same
thought
for
moment
what
makes
you
think
you
will
have
second
asked
to
judge
from
the
easy
way
in
which
those
two
are
knocking
the
bowling
about
sha'n't
even
have
first
he
smiled
moved
on
again
hallo
said
voice
saw
you
get
out
how
many
did
you
make
none
said
wearily
how
many
went
and
sat
down
next
to
him
guess
said
oh
can't
well
think
of
number
yes
double
it
divide
by
two
take
away
the
number
you
first
thought
of
what
does
that
make
hundred
you
must
have
done
it
wrong
said
suspiciously
no
am
sure
didn't
no
it
still
comes
to
hundred
well
then
must
have
made
hundred
said
excitedly
are
you
sure
you
haven't
made
mistake
quite
then
i'd
better
go
and
tell
the
scorer
he
put
me
down
blob
silly
ass
he's
bad
scorer
know
by
the
way
said
as
got
up
what
number
did
you
think
of
well
it's
like
this
when
you
asked
me
to
guess
what
you
had
made
instinctively
thought
of
blob
only
didn't
like
to
say
so
then
when
you
began
that
number
game
started
with
hundred
it's
such
an
easy
number
double
two
hundred
divided
by
two
one
hundred
take
away
the
number
you
first
thought
of
that's
blob
and
you
have
hundred
left
wasn't
that
right
you
idiot
said
angrily
of
course
it
wasn't
well
don't
get
sick
about
it
we
all
make
mistakes
sick
i'm
not
sick
only
just
for
the
moment
really
thought
well
shall
never
be
so
near
century
again
at
lunch
sat
next
to
one
of
their
side
how
many
did
you
make
he
asked
not
very
many
said
how
many
oh
hardly
any
none
at
all
practically
how
many
actually
and
actually
said
fool
after
lunch
strange
man
happened
to
be
talking
to
me
and
why
did
you
get
out
he
asked
it
was
silly
question
and
deserved
silly
answer
besides
was
sick
of
it
all
by
this
time
point's
moustache
put
me
off
said
what
was
wrong
with
point's
moustache
it
swerved
the
wrong
way
was
fielding
point
he
said
i'm
very
sorry
but
if
you
had
recognised
me
you
wouldn't
have
asked
why
got
out
and
if
had
recognised
you
shouldn't
have
told
you
so
let's
forgive
and
forget
hoped
that
the
subject
was
really
closed
this
time
of
course
knew
that
kind
friends
and
relations
would
ask
me
on
the
morrow
how
many
had
made
but
for
that
day
wanted
no
more
of
it
yet
as
it
happened
reopened
the
subject
myself
for
with
five
minutes
to
play
their
ninth
wicket
fell
mid-off
sauntered
over
towards
me
just
as
well
we
didn't
stay
in
any
longer
that's
just
what
thought
said
triumphantly
all
along
an
average
man
of
tomkins
as
natural
cricketer
it
frequently
has
been
remarked
that
if
he'd
had
more
opportunities
of
bowling
and
rather
more
encouragement
in
batting
and
if
his
averages
so
disclosed
batting
and
bowling
had
been
interchanged
and
if
the
field
as
usually
set
contained
some
post
at
the
pavilion
end
whose
presence
rather
than
pair
of
hands
was
called
for
then
before
the
season
finished
tomkins
would
certainly
have
played
for
kent
all
this
however
is
beside
the
mark
just
now
wish
to
hymn
the
glorious
day
ignored
by
those
who
write
the
almanacs
unnoticed
by
the
calendar
compilers
that
wednesday
afternoon
twelve
months
ago
when
tomkins
raised
his
average
to
two
thanks
to
an
interval
of
accidents
as
tomkins
did
not
bat
and
not
out
but
this
more
rarely
tomkins'
average
had
long
remained
at
though
tomkins
sacrificing
truth
to
pride
or
both
to
euphony
left
out
the
dot
left
out
the
little
dot
upon
the
three
only
employing
it
to
justify
second
three
to
follow
on
the
first
thus
if
stranger
asked
his
average
tomkins
would
answer
one
point
thirty-three
nor
lay
the
stress
unduly
on
the
one
curious
thing
is
custom
there
are
men
plum
warner
is
of
course
case
in
point
who
cannot
bat
unless
they
go
in
first
others
as
hayes
and
denton
have
their
place
first
wicket
down
while
number
six
or
so
is
suited
best
to
jessop
as
for
tomkins
his
place
was
always
one
above
the
byes
and
three
above
the
wides
so
custom
willed
upon
this
famous
wednesday
afternoon
wickets
had
fallen
fast
before
the
onslaught
of
one
who
had
as
euclid
might
have
put
it
no
length
or
break
but
only
pace
and
pace
had
been
too
much
for
nine
of
them
already
then
entered
tomkins
the
invincible
took
guard
as
usual
just
outside
the
leg
looked
round
the
field
and
mentally
decided
to
die
or
raise
his
average
to
two
whereon
for
now
the
bowler
was
approaching
he
struck
scientific
attitude
advanced
the
left
leg
firmly
down
the
pitch
and
swung
his
bat
along
the
line
ab
see
ranjitsinhji's
famous
book
of
cricket
and
when
the
bat
and
leg
were
both
at
having
arrived
there
more
or
less
together
then
tomkins
with
his
usual
self-effacement
modestly
closed
his
eyes
and
left
the
rest
to
providence
and
ranjy
and
the
bowler
forming
quorum
two
at
least
of
whom
resolved
that
he
should
neatly
glide
the
ball
somewhere
between
the
first
and
second
slips
so
tomkins
did
compile
chanceless
two
once
more
the
bowler
rushed
upon
the
crease
while
tomkins
made
hasty
calculation
necessitating
use
of
decimals
and
found
his
average
was
so
lustily
he
smote
and
drove
the
ball
loftily
over
long
stop's
head
for
one
which
brought
the
decimal
to
seventy-five
and
tomkins
puffing
to
the
other
end
then
feeling
that
the
time
for
risks
was
come
he
rolled
his
sleeves
up
blew
upon
his
hands
and
played
back
to
yorker
and
was
bowled
every
position
has
its
special
charm
you
go
in
first
and
find
as
reward
the
wicket
at
its
best
you
go
in
later
and
find
the
fielders
slack
the
bowling
loose
tomkins
who
went
in
just
above
the
byes
found
one
of
them
had
slipped
into
his
score
tis
wise
to
take
the
good
the
gods
provide
you
and
tomkins
has
an
average
of
two
small
games
physical
culture
why
don't
you
sit
up
said
adela
at
dinner
suddenly
prodding
me
in
the
back
adela
is
old
enough
to
take
motherly
interest
in
my
figure
and
young
enough
to
look
extremely
pretty
while
doing
so
always
stoop
at
meals
explained
it
helps
the
circulation
my
own
idea
but
it
looks
so
bad
you
ought
don't
improve
me
begged
no
wonder
you
have
hush
haven't
got
bullet
on
the
liver
in
the
campaign
of
due
to
over-smoking
and
sometimes
it
hurts
me
little
in
the
cold
weather
that's
all
why
don't
you
try
the
hyperion
will
where
is
it
it
isn't
anywhere
you
buy
it
oh
thought
you
dined
at
it
what
do
you
buy
it
for
it's
one
of
those
developers
with
elastics
and
pulleys
and
so
on
every
morning
early
for
half-an
hour
before
breakfast
you
are
trying
to
improve
me
said
suspiciously
but
they
are
such
good
things
went
on
adela
earnestly
they
really
do
help
to
make
you
beautiful
am
beautiful
well
much
more
beautiful
and
strong
are
you
being
simply
as
tactful
as
you
can
be
and
graceful
it
isn't
as
though
you
were
actually
relation
protested
adela
continued
full
of
her
ideas
it
would
do
you
so
much
good
you
know
would
you
promise
me
to
use
it
every
day
if
sent
you
mine
why
don't
you
want
yours
any
more
now
are
you
perfect
now
you
can
easily
hook
it
to
the
wall
suppose
reflected
there
is
limit
of
beauty
beyond
which
it
is
dangerous
to
go
after
that
either
the
thing
would
come
off
the
hook
or
well
said
adela
suddenly
aren't
looking
well
you're
looking
radiant
said
appreciatively
but
it
may
only
be
because
you're
going
to
marry
billy
next
month
she
smiled
and
blushed
well
i'll
send
it
to
you
she
said
and
you
try
it
for
week
and
then
tell
me
if
you
don't
feel
better
oh
and
don't
do
all
the
exercises
to
begin
with
start
with
three
or
four
of
the
easy
ones
of
course
said
undid
the
wrappings
eagerly
took
off
the
lid
of
the
box
and
was
confronted
with
apparently
six
pairs
of
braces
shook
them
out
of
the
box
and
saw
had
made
mistake
it
was
one
pair
of
braces
for
magog
picked
it
up
and
knew
that
was
in
the
presence
of
the
hyperion
in
five
minutes
had
screwed
hook
into
the
bedroom
wall
and
attached
the
beautifier
then
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looked
at
it
there
was
tin
plate
fastened
to
the
top
with
the
word
ladies
on
it
got
up
removed
it
with
knife
and
sat
down
again
everything
was
very
dusty
and
wondered
when
adela
had
last
developed
herself
by-and
by
went
into
the
other
room
to
see
if
had
overlooked
anything
found
on
the
floor
chart
of
exercises
and
returned
triumphantly
with
it
there
were
thirty
exercises
altogether
and
the
chart
gave
detailed
explanation
of
how
to
do
each
particular
exercise
photograph
of
lady
doing
it
after
all
reassured
myself
after
the
first
bashful
glance
it
is
adela
who
has
thrust
this
upon
me
and
she
must
have
known
so
studied
it
nos
and
seemed
the
easiest
decided
to
confine
myself
to
them
for
the
first
of
these
you
strap
yourself
in
at
the
waist
grasp
the
handles
and
fall
slowly
backwards
until
your
head
touches
the
floor
all
the
elastic
cords
being
then
at
full
stretch
when
had
got
very
slowly
halfway
down
an
extra
piece
of
elastic
which
had
got
hitched
somewhere
came
suddenly
into
play
and
did
the
rest
of
the
journey
without
stop
finishing
up
sharply
against
the
towel
horse
the
chart
had
said
inhale
going
down
and
was
inhaling
hard
at
the
moment
that
the
towel
horse
and
two
damp
towels
spread
themselves
over
my
face
so
much
for
exercise
thought
as
got
up
i'll
just
get
the
idea
to-night
and
then
start
properly
to-morrow
now
for
no
somehow
felt
instinctively
that
no
would
cause
trouble
for
no
you
stand
on
the
right
foot
fasten
the
left
foot
to
one
of
the
cords
and
stretch
it
out
as
far
as
you
can
what
officially
you
do
then
cannot
say
some
people
can
stand
easily
upon
the
right
foot
when
the
left
is
fastened
to
the
wall
others
cannot
it
is
gift
having
recovered
from
my
spontaneous
rendering
of
no
turned
to
no
this
one
realised
was
extremely
important
would
do
it
twelve
times
you
begin
by
lying
flat
on
the
floor
roped
in
at
the
waist
and
with
your
hands
grasping
the
elastic
cords
held
straight
up
in
the
air
the
tension
on
your
waist
is
then
extreme
but
on
your
hands
only
moderate
then
taking
deep
breath
you
pull
your
arms
slowly
out
until
they
lie
along
the
floor
the
tension
becomes
terrific
the
strain
on
every
part
of
you
is
immense
while
lay
there
taking
deep
breath
before
relaxing
said
to
myself
the
strain
will
be
too
much
for
me
was
wrong
it
was
too
much
for
the
hook
the
hook
whizzed
out
everything
flew
at
me
at
once
and
remembered
no
more
as
limped
into
bed
trod
heavily
upon
something
sharp
shrieked
and
bent
down
to
see
what
had
bitten
me
it
was
tin
plate
bearing
the
words
ladies
well
said
adela
week
later
looked
at
her
for
long
time
when
did
you
last
use
the
hyperion
asked
about
year
ago
ah
you
don't
remember
the
chart
that
went
with
it
not
well
except
of
course
that
each
exercise
was
arranged
for
particular
object
according
to
what
you
wanted
exactly
so
discovered
yesterday
it
was
in
very
small
type
and
missed
it
at
first
well
how
many
did
you
do
limited
myself
to
exercises
and
do
you
happen
to
remember
what
those
were
for
not
particularly
no
well
started
with
no
no
you
may
recall
is
one
of
the
most
perilous
nearly
died
over
no
and
when
had
been
doing
it
for
week
discovered
what
its
particular
object
was
what
to
round
the
forearm
yes
madam
said
bitterly
have
spent
week
of
agony
and
have
rounded
one
forearm
why
didn't
you
try
another
did
tried
no
six
times
in
the
pursuit
of
no
have
been
shot
up
to
the
ceiling
by
the
left
foot
and
what
for
adela
to
arch
the
instep
look
at
my
instep
why
should
want
to
arch
it
wish
could
remember
which
chart
sent
you
said
adela
wrinkling
her
brow
it
was
the
wrong
one
said
there
was
long
silence
oh
said
adela
suddenly
you
never
told
me
about
no
pardon
me
said
cannot
bear
to
speak
of
why
was
it
even
more
unsuitable
than
the
other
two
found
when
had
done
it
six
times
that
its
object
was
stated
to
be
to
remove
double
chin
that
however
was
not
the
real
effect
and
so
crossed
out
the
false
comment
and
wrote
the
true
one
in
its
place
and
what
is
that
asked
adela
to
remove
the
hook
said
gloomily
croquet
prologue
hear
you're
very
good
at
croquet
said
my
hostess
oh
well
said
modestly
the
fact
is
can
beat
them
all
at
home
we
have
the
north
rutland
champion
staying
with
us
he's
very
keen
on
game
now
then
how
can
we
manage
this
was
terrible
must
put
it
off
somehow
is
there
north
to
rutland
began
argumentatively
always
thought
yes
see
he
shall
play
with
jane
against
you
and
miss
middleton
by
the
way
let
me
introduce
you
all
we
bowed
to
each
other
for
bit
and
then
had
another
shock
the
champion's
mallet
was
bound
with
brass
at
each
end
in
case
he
wanted
to
hit
backwards
suddenly
and
had
silver
plate
on
it
jane's
had
the
brass
only
it
was
absurd
that
they
should
play
together
drew
miss
middleton
on
one
side
say
began
nervously
i'm
frightfully
sorry
but
quite
forgot
to
bring
my
mallet
will
it
matter
very
much
haven't
one
either
you
know
when
my
man
was
packing
my
bag
particularly
said
to
him
now
don't
forget
to
put
in
mallet
he
said
shall
put
the
spare
one
in
too
sir
because
the
best
one's
sprung
bit
oh
i've
never
had
one
of
my
own
suppose
when
one
is
really
good
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i've
never
had
one
either
we're
fairly
in
for
it
now
never
mind
we'll
amuse
ourselves
somehow
expect
oh
i'm
quite
looking
forward
to
it
chapter
they
kicked
off
from
the
summer-house
end
and
after
jockeying
for
the
start
bit
the
champion
got
going
he
went
very
slowly
but
very
surely
watched
anxiously
for
ten
minutes
expecting
my
turn
every
moment
after
quarter
of
an
hour
raised
my
hat
and
moved
away
shall
we
sit
down
said
to
miss
middleton
we
shall
be
in
the
way
if
we
sit
down
here
sha'n't
we
outside
that
chalk
line
we're
safe
suppose
so
we
moved
outside
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
never
even
had
chalk
line
said
mournfully
it's
much
more
fun
without
you
know
went
on
can
beat
them
all
at
home
why
even
wilfrid
it's
just
the
same
with
me
said
miss
middleton
hilda
did
win
once
by
frightful
fluke
but
but
this
is
quite
different
at
home
it
would
be
considered
jolly
bad
form
to
go
on
all
this
time
one
would
simply
go
in
and
leave
them
said
miss
middleton
you
know
it's
awful
fun
at
home
the
lawn
goes
down
in
terraces
and
if
you
hit
the
other
person's
ball
hard
enough
you
can
get
it
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
it
takes
at
least
six
to
get
back
on
the
green
again
miss
middleton
gurgled
to
herself
we've
got
stream
round
our
lawn
she
said
in
gasps
it's
such
joke
and
once
when
hilda
chapter
ii
may
call
you
mary
said
we're
still
here
well
we
have
known
each
other
long
time
certainly
said
miss
middleton
think
you
might
thanks
very
much
what
hoop
is
he
at
he's
just
half-way
suppose
when
he's
finished
then
jane
does
it
all
it
practically
comes
to
that
believe
as
matter
of
form
am
allowed
shot
in
between
that
won't
make
any
difference
will
it
no
it's
awfully
hot
isn't
it
yes
do
you
bicycle
much
no
do
you
no
generally
sleep
in
the
afternoons
much
the
best
thing
to
do
good-night
good-night
chapter
iii
wake
up
said
you've
been
asleep
for
hours
jane
is
playing
now
oh
i'm
so
sorry
said
mary
still
with
her
eyes
closed
then
missed
your
turn
was
it
good
one
absolutely
splendid
had
very
long
shot
and
hit
the
champion
then
took
my
mallet
in
both
hands
brought
it
well
over
the
shoulder
are
you
allowed
to
do
that
by
the
way
yes
it's
hockey
where
you
mustn't
and
croqueted
him
right
down
to
the
house
over
beds
through
bushes
across
paths
the
longest
ball
i've
ever
driven
hope
you
didn't
make
him
very
cross
you
see
he
may
not
be
used
to
our
game
cross
my
dear
girl
he
was
fairly
chuckling
with
delight
told
me
i'd
missed
the
rest
of
my
turn
it
seems
that
if
you
go
over
two
beds
and
across
more
than
one
path
you
miss
the
rest
of
your
turn
did
you
know
that
suppose
did
really
but
i'd
forgotten
and
here
am
again
jane
will
be
even
longer
he's
lying
on
the
grass
and
taking
sights
for
her
just
now
why
didn't
you
answer
my
last
letter
chapter
iv
it's
this
passion
for
games
said
waking
up
suddenly
which
has
made
us
englishmen
what
we
are
here
we
have
hot
july
afternoon
when
all
nature
is
at
peace
and
the
foreigner
is
taking
his
siesta
and
what
do
we
do
how
do
we
english
men
and
women
spend
this
hot
afternoon
why
immediately
after
lunch
in
one
case
even
before
the
meal
has
been
digested
we
rush
off
to
take
part
in
some
violent
game
like
croquet
hour
after
hour
the
play
goes
on
relentlessly
there
is
no
backing
out
on
our
part
no
pleading
for
just
five
minutes
in
which
to
get
our
wind
no
we
bear
our
part
manfully
and
are
you
awake
by
any
chance
or
am
wasting
all
this
of
course
i'm
awake
said
mary
opening
her
eyes
what
years
have
known
you
do
you
remember
those
days
when
we
used
to
paddle
together
the
mixed
paddling
at
brighton
ah
yes
and
your
first
paint-box
and
your
doll
and
the
pony
and
the
good-night
g'night
chapter
xviii
but
how
absurd
said
mary
when
we've
only
just
met
oh
but
come
it
was
about
two
years
ago
that
you
let
me
call
you
mary
true
said
mary
thoughtfully
and
you
can't
say
we
aren't
suited
to
one
another
we
both
play
without
the
chalk
line
so
we
do
yet
oh
can't
say
all
at
once
give
me
little
time
i'll
give
you
three
of
jane's
hoops
that's
about
six
months
chapter
xx
twenty-eight
said
the
north
rutland
champion
that's
what
won
the
championship
by
remember
it's
good
winning
score
said
do
they
play
much
in
north
rutland
i'm
afraid
it's
been
very
slow
for
you
and
miss
middleton
said
jane
not
exactly
slow
said
we've
been
talking
lot
of
nonsense
explained
miss
middleton
not
exactly
nonsense
said
oh
it
was
said
miss
middleton
you
know
it
was
suppose
it
was
sighed
well
we'll
try
again
to-morrow
right
said
the
champion
but
shall
use
my
other
mallet
gardening
there
may
be
gardeners
who
can
appear
to
be
busy
all
the
year
round
doing
even
in
the
winter
their
little
bit
under
glass
but
for
myself
wait
reverently
until
the
twenty-second
of
march
is
here
then
spring
having
officially
arrived
step
out
on
to
the
lawn
and
summon
my
head-gardener
james
say
the
winter
is
over
at
last
what
have
we
got
in
that
big
brown-looking
bed
in
the
middle
there
well
sir
he
says
we
don't
seem
to
have
anything
do
we
like
perhaps
there's
something
down
below
that
hasn't
pushed
through
yet
maybe
there
is
wish
you
knew
more
about
it
say
angrily
want
to
bed
out
the
macaroni
there
have
we
got
spare
bed
with
nothing
going
on
underneath
don't
know
sir
shall
dig
em
up
and
have
look
yes
perhaps
you'd
better
say
between
ourselves
james
is
man
of
no
initiative
he
has
to
be
told
everything
however
mention
of
him
brings
me
to
my
first
rule
for
young
gardeners
never
sow
spring
onions
and
new
potatoes
in
the
same
bed
did
this
by
accident
last
year
the
fact
is
when
the
onions
were
given
to
me
quite
thought
they
were
young
daffodils
mistake
anyone
might
make
of
course
don't
generally
keep
daffodils
and
potatoes
together
but
james
swore
that
the
hard
round
things
were
tulip
bulbs
it
is
perfectly
useless
to
pay
your
head-gardener
half-a
crown
week
if
he
doesn't
know
the
difference
between
potatoes
and
tulip
bulbs
well
anyhow
there
they
were
in
the
herbaceous
border
together
and
they
grew
up
side
by
side
the
onions
getting
stronger
every
day
and
the
potatoes
more
sensitive
at
last
just
when
they
were
ripe
for
picking
found
that
the
young
onions
had
actually
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
potatoes
to
such
an
extent
that
the
latter
were
too
damp
for
baking
or
roasting
and
had
to
be
mashed
now
as
everybody
knows
mashed
potatoes
are
beastly
the
rhubarb
border
gives
me
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
the
garden
started
it
year
ago
with
the
idea
of
keeping
the
sun
off
the
young
carnations
it
acted
excellently
and
the
complexion
of
the
flowers
was
improved
tenfold
then
one
day
discovered
james
busily
engaged
in
pulling
up
the
rhubarb
what
are
you
doing
cried
do
you
want
the
young
carnations
to
go
all
brown
was
going
to
send
some
in
to
the
cook
he
grumbled
to
the
cook
what
do
you
mean
rhubarb
isn't
vegetable
no
it's
fruit
looked
at
james
anxiously
he
had
large
hat
on
and
the
sun
couldn't
have
got
to
the
back
of
his
neck
my
dear
james
said
don't
pay
you
half-a
crown
week
for
being
funny
perhaps
we
had
better
make
it
two
shillings
in
future
however
he
persisted
in
his
theory
that
in
the
spring
people
stewed
rhubarb
in
tarts
and
ate
it
well
have
discovered
since
that
this
is
actually
so
people
really
do
grow
it
in
their
gardens
not
with
the
idea
of
keeping
the
sun
off
the
young
carnations
but
under
the
impression
that
it
is
fruit
consequently
have
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
firm
line
with
my
friends'
rhubarb
on
arriving
at
any
house
for
visit
the
first
thing
say
to
my
host
is
may
see
your
rhubarb
bed
have
heard
such
lot
about
it
by
all
means
he
says
feeling
rather
flattered
and
leads
the
way
into
the
garden
what
glorious
sunset
say
pointing
to
the
west
isn't
it
he
says
turning
round
and
then
surreptitiously
drop
pint
of
weed-killer
on
the
bed
next
morning
get
up
early
and
paint
the
roots
of
the
survivors
with
iodine
once
my
host
who
for
some
reason
had
got
up
early
too
discovered
me
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
just
painting
the
roots
with
iodine
said
to
prevent
the
rhubarb
falling
out
to
prevent
what
to
keep
the
green
fly
away
corrected
myself
it's
the
new
french
intensive
system
but
he
was
suspicious
and
had
to
leave
two
or
three
stalks
untreated
we
had
those
for
lunch
that
day
there
was
only
one
thing
for
self-respecting
man
to
do
obtained
large
plateful
of
the
weed
and
emptied
the
sugar
basin
and
the
cream
jug
over
it
then
took
mouthful
of
the
pastry
gave
little
start
and
said
oh
is
this
rhubarb
i'm
sorry
didn't
know
whereupon
pushed
my
plate
away
and
started
on
the
cheese
asparagus
asparagus
wants
watching
very
carefully
it
requires
to
be
tended
like
child
frequently
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
wonder
if
james
has
remembered
to
put
the
hot-water
bottle
in
the
asparagus
bed
whenever
get
up
to
look
find
that
he
has
forgotten
he
tells
me
to-day
that
he
is
beginning
to
think
that
the
things
which
are
coming
up
now
are
not
asparagus
after
all
but
young
hyacinths
this
is
very
annoying
am
inclined
to
fancy
that
james
is
not
the
man
he
was
for
the
sake
of
his
reputation
in
the
past
hope
he
is
not
potting
out
have
spent
busy
morning
potting
out
the
nasturtiums
we
have
them
in
three
qualities
mild
medium
and
full
nasturtiums
are
extremely
peppery
flowers
and
take
offence
so
quickly
that
the
utmost
tact
is
required
to
pot
them
successfully
in
general
way
all
the
red
or
reddish
flowers
should
be
potted
as
soon
as
they
are
old
enough
to
stand
it
but
it
is
considered
bad
form
among
horticulturists
to
pot
the
white
james
has
been
sowing
the
roses
wanted
all
the
pink
ones
in
one
bed
and
all
the
yellow
ones
in
another
and
so
on
but
james
says
you
never
can
tell
for
certain
what
colour
flower
is
going
to
be
until
it
comes
up
of
course
any
fool
could
tell
then
you
should
go
by
the
picture
on
the
outside
of
the
packet
said
they're
very
misleading
said
james
anyhow
they
must
be
all
brothers
in
the
same
packet
you
might
have
brother
with
red
hair
says
james
hadn't
thought
of
that
grafting
grafting
is
when
you
try
short
approaches
over
the
pergola
in
somebody's
else's
garden
and
break
the
best
tulip
you
mend
it
with
ha'penny
stamp
and
hope
that
nobody
will
notice
at
any
rate
not
until
you
have
gone
away
on
the
monday
of
course
in
your
own
garden
you
never
want
to
graft
hope
at
some
future
time
to
be
allowed
even
encouraged
to
refer
to
such
things
as
the
most
artistic
way
to
frame
cucumbers
how
to
stop
tomatoes
blushing
the
hom
oe
opathic
method
of
putting
them
next
to
the
french
beans
is
now
discredited
and
spring
fashions
in
fox
gloves
but
for
the
moment
have
said
enough
the
great
thing
to
remember
in
gardening
is
that
flowers
fruits
and
vegetables
alike
can
only
be
cultivated
with
sympathy
special
attention
should
be
given
to
backward
and
delicate
plants
they
should
be
encouraged
to
make
the
most
of
themselves
never
forget
that
flowers
like
ourselves
are
particular
about
the
company
they
keep
if
hyacinth
droops
in
the
celery
bed
put
it
among
the
pansies
but
above
all
mind
firm
hand
with
the
rhubarb
golf
chapter
the
documents
in
the
case
are
these
him
to
me
come
and
play
golf
on
thursday
what
is
your
handicap
expect
you
will
be
too
good
for
me
me
to
him
my
good
thomas
don't
be
silly
will
play
you
at
cricket
tennis
lawn
tennis
football
both
codes
croquet
poker-patience
high
diving
and
here-we
go-round
the-mulberry
bush
if
you
insist
will
take
you
on
at
prisoners'
base
and
billiards
moreover
can
dance
the
pavane
yours
ever
adolphus
anyhow
haven't
any
clubs
him
to
me
my
dear
ass
gather
that
you
aren't
golfer
well
why
not
begin
on
thursday
there
will
be
nobody
else
playing
probably
meet
me
at
victoria
eleven-five
my
brother
is
away
and
will
lend
you
his
clubs
me
to
him
telegram
is
your
brother
out
of
england
wire
reply
him
to
me
yes
sicily
me
to
him
right
you
are
then
chapter
ii
you
know
said
to
thomas
in
the
train
have
played
little
on
very
small
island
off
the
coast
of
scotland
but
it
was
such
very
small
island
that
we
never
used
driver
at
all
or
what's
that
other
thing
called
brassy
we
should
have
been
into
the
sea
in
no
time
but
rather
fancy
myself
with
putter
you
might
go
round
with
putter
to-day
might
but
sha'n't
expect
to
use
the
wooden
clubs
with
great
ease
and
dexterity
and
think
you
will
find
that
can
do
some
business
with
the
mashie
what's
niblick
the
thing
you
get
out
of
bunkers
with
then
sha'n't
want
that
chapter
iii
the
fateful
moment
arrived
thomas
presented
me
with
ball
called
the
colonel
and
caddie
offered
me
thomas's
brother's
driver
he
also
asked
me
what
sort
of
tee
should
like
leant
upon
my
club
and
looked
at
him
then
turned
to
thomas
our
young
friend
hector
said
is
becoming
technical
will
you
explain
well
do
you
want
high
or
low
one
want
to
hit
this
colonel
ball
very
hard
in
the
direction
of
that
flag
what
do
you
recommend
well
that's
just
as
you
think
medium
one
slow
to
medium
the
preliminaries
being
arranged
proceeded
to
address
the
ball
my
own
instinct
was
to
take
the
address
as
read
and
get
to
business
as
soon
as
possible
but
in
the
presence
of
an
expert
like
hector
did
not
dare
to
omit
the
trimmings
as
it
was
after
every
waggle
felt
less
and
less
like
hitting
the
colonel
when
at
last
did
let
fly
it
was
with
feelings
of
relief
that
discovered
on
returning
an
eye
to
the
spot
that
the
tee
was
indeed
empty
shaded
my
eyes
and
gazed
into
the
middle
distance
no
said
thomas
it's
more
to
the
right
he
indicated
spot
in
the
foreground
about
ten
yards
there
you
are
that
isn't
my
ball
yes
sir
said
hector
grinning
may
have
it
back
thomas
laughed
and
smote
his
own
into
the
blue
you
go
on
from
there
he
said
i'm
still
aiming
at
the
same
flag
go
on
you
ass
went
on
the
ball
again
rolled
ten
yards
to
the
east
don't
know
why
we're
going
in
this
direction
said
if
get
much
further
east
shall
have
to
send
back
bartlett
you
know
don't
believe
the
colonel
is
taking
this
seriously
he
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
trying
at
all
has
he
ever
been
round
the
course
before
never
he's
quite
new
to
it
there
you
are
he'll
come
down
at
the
ditch
for
certainty
played
my
third
third
time
we
went
ten
yards
to
the
east
well
perhaps
with
touch
of
north
in
it
again
and
this
time
hector
gave
sudden
snort
of
laughter
leant
upon
my
club
and
stared
him
into
gravity
then
took
thomas
by
the
coat
and
led
him
on
one
side
there
are
thomas
said
other
things
than
golf
there
are
he
agreed
man
may
fail
temporarily
at
the
game
and
yet
not
be
wholly
despicable
true
he
may
for
instance
be
able
to
dance
the
pavane
with
grace
and
distinction
quite
so
well
then
will
you
take
this
giggling
child
away
and
explain
to
him
that
am
not
such
an
ass
as
appear
tell
him
that
the
intellectuals
of
brook
green
think
highly
of
my
mental
powers
assure
him
that
in
many
of
the
best
houses
at
wandsworth
common
am
held
to
be
an
amusing
raconteur
remind
him
of
my
villanelle
to
autumn
for
heaven's
sake
make
him
understand
that
my
reputation
does
not
stand
or
fall
with
my
ability
to
use
this
brassy
thing
i'm
not
golf
professional
thomas
allowed
himself
to
smile
will
tell
him
he
said
that
you
are
not
golf
professional
we
veered
right
round
to
the
east
with
my
fourth
and
then
became
desperate
why
shouted
do
hit
the
ball
with
ridiculous
club
like
this
could
send
it
farther
with
cricket
bat
could
push
it
straighter
with
billiard
cue
where's
that
bag
am
going
to
have
lucky
dip
dipped
and
came
up
with
what
thomas
called
cleek
now
then
said
didn't
stop
to
address
the
colonel
simply
lashed
at
him
he
flew
along
the
ground
at
terrific
pace
well
kept
down
said
thomas
admiringly
by
jove
cried
that's
never
going
to
stop
see
how
he
flies
along
now
he
breasts
the
slope
look
he
is
taking
the
water
jump
ah
he
has
crossed
his
legs
he's
down
this
said
to
thomas
as
we
walked
after
the
colonel
is
golf
glorious
game
what
nonsense
said
to
thomas
they
put
in
comic
papers
about
golf
all
that
about
digging
up
the
turf
and
missing
the
ball
and
breaking
the
clubs
mean
simply
don't
see
how
one
could
let's
see
i've
played
four
haven't
five
said
thomas
what
am
wondering
he
added
is
why
you
should
have
been
afraid
of
using
any
club
in
your
small
island
off
the
coast
of
scotland
chapter
iv
twenty
strokes
after
the
green
the
green
shouted
joyfully
in
the
manner
of
the
ancient
greeks
though
was
only
on
the
edge
of
it
go
on
said
thomas
took
careful
aim
and
put
the
white
down
you
see
said
carelessly
leaning
on
my
putter
stump
cricket
april
will
soon
be
here
said
miss
middleton
with
sigh
of
happiness
bless
it
agreed
my
favourite
month
twelve
added
conversationally
is
my
lucky
number
and
thursday
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
do
least
work
when
next
the
twelfth
of
april
falls
on
thursday
which
may
not
be
for
centuries
look
out
something
terrific
will
happen
it's
about
now
that
one
begins
to
wonder
if
one
is
in
form
or
likely
to
be
just
about
now
agreed
always
say
that
when
the
draw
is
announced
for
the
semi-finals
of
the
english
cup
in
which
of
course
take
not
the
slightest
interest
whatever
and
in
fact
hardly
know
what
teams
are
left
in
for
it
though
must
say
hope
southampton
wins
this
year
because
after
all
fry
did
play
for
them
once
but
they'll
have
bit
of
job
to
beat
the
wolves
you
know
and
then
there's
newcastle
and
fulham
after
that
and
of
course
you
can't
be
i'm
tired
of
that
sentence
said
miss
middleton
so
was
only
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
have
no
use
for
these
spectacular
gladiatorial
combats
give
me
cricket
the
game
of
miss
middleton
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
do
you
bowl
as
fast
and
as
good
length
as
you
talk
she
asked
thoughtfully
no
more
swerve
perhaps
and
bowl
with
my
head
good
deal
see
quite
different
well
then
will
you
coach
me
this
spring
do
there's
dear
should
love
to
know
all
the
things
to
say
she
got
up
excitedly
come
along
then
i've
got
the
rippingest
bat
but
you
must
promise
not
to
bowl
too
fast
had
said
that
knew
all
the
things
to
say
but
as
matter
of
fact
there
is
only
one
thing
to
say
you
should
have
come
out
to
er
sir
or
suppose
in
miss
middleton's
case
you
should
have
come
out
to
him
madam
it's
silly
remark
to
make
because
it
is
just
what
one
is
always
doing
at
school
could
come
out
to
anything
that
was
straight
and
not
too
high
the
difficulty
lay
in
staying
in
nobody
ever
told
me
how
to
do
that
miss
middleton
led
the
way
to
walled-in
tennis
lawn
which
lay
next
to
the
broccoli
tops
and
things
and
was
kept
away
from
it
by
only
six
feet
of
brick
if
it
had
simply
been
question
of
cabbage
should
have
said
nothing
but
there
would
be
grapes
there
too
know
said
miss
middleton
but
we
must
play
against
wall
don't
bowl
too
much
to
leg
hadn't
bowled
since
october
the
fourth
the
first
post-october
ball
was
trifle
over-pitched
and
little
too
much
to
the
right
all
the
same
was
just
saying
you
should
have
come
out
to
that
one
when
there
was
crash
from
the
direction
of
long-on
by
jove
didn't
know
you
were
so
good
was
that
the
grapes
how
awful
yes
it
simply
seemed
to
fly
off
the
bat
did
ask
you
not
to
bowl
there
didn't
she
looked
so
penitent
that
had
to
comfort
her
it's
all
right
said
consolingly
had
man
there
you
would
have
been
out
all
the
way
besides
went
on
little
air
will
do
the
grapes
good
they
stay
all
the
time
in
one
hot
room
and
then
when
they
go
out
into
the
cold
they
don't
muffle
up
and
the
natural
consequence
is
or
am
thinking
of
influenza
never
mind
we
must
remember
not
to
do
it
again
that's
all
give
me
some
to
cut
there
are
several
ways
of
cutting
for
myself
was
taught
to
cut
square
with
the
left
leg
across
and
late
with
the
right
the
consequence
being
that
can
do
neither
to
work
downwards
generally
uses
the
fore-arm
for
the
stroke
ranji
the
wrist
miss
middleton
keeps
both
feet
together
and
puts
her
whole
body
into
it
and
the
direction
in
which
the
ball
travels
is
towards
long-on
there
was
another
crash
golf
is
your
game
said
admiringly
you
lay
it
dead
on
the
greenhouse
every
time
say
what
shall
we
do
father
will
be
furious
looked
at
my
watch
can
just
catch
the
three-twenty
five
said
oh
don't
be
coward
when
it's
all
your
fault
for
bowling
so
badly
perhaps
the
glass
is
insured
suggested
it
is
generally
it's
insured
against
hail
she
said
doubtfully
looked
at
the
sky
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
blues
have
seen
no
said
miss
middleton
sadly
it
will
be
point
for
lawyers
to
argue
fancy
what
is
actually
meant
by
hail
you
would
probably
define
it
at
once
as
aqueous
vapour
cooled
down
in
the
atmosphere
to
the
freezing
point
of
water
don't
know
perhaps
should
but
hail'
here
obviously
has
wider
significance
take
it
to
mean
anything
that
descends
suddenly
from
the
clouds
haven't
williams
on
real
property'
with
me
but
come
on
said
miss
middleton
let's
say
it
does
mean
that
and
could
you
please
keep
them
bit
more
on
the
off
it's
no
good
my
keeping
them
there
if
you
don't
the
worst
of
coaching
speak
now
as
an
expert
is
that
it
is
so
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
when
lady
whirls
her
bat
twice
round
her
head
gives
little
shriek
gets
the
ball
on
the
knee
and
says
what
ought
to
have
done
then
the
only
answer
could
think
of
was
not
that
thought
you
knew
all
about
coaching
she
said
scornfully
but
you
see
it
depends
on
what
you
were
wanting
to
do
said
meekly
if
it
was
drive
you
should
have
come
out
to
it
more
and
if
it
was
cut
you
should
have
come
down
on
it
while
if
it
was
highland
fling
you
lacked
abandon
and
if
you
were
killing
wasp
good
coach
would
know
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
with
that
particular
ball
wouldn't
he
and
that's
just
what
he
would
tell
you
he
wouldn't
know
said
modestly
you
don't
often
meet
that
sort
of
ball
in
good
cricket
no
suppose
not
that's
why
didn't
know
what
to
do
expect
you
know
generally
know
exactly
what
to
do
only
can't
do
it
is
that
really
so
cried
excitedly
why
then
of
course
you
ought
to
coach
me
we
had
very
jolly
afternoon
fancy
shall
be
in
some
form
this
year
miss
middleton
is
one
of
the
best
bowlers
have
seen
but
brought
off
some
beautiful
shots
wanted
some
tea
badly
afterwards
what
glorious
days
we
have
now
said
miss
middleton's
mother
as
she
handed
me
cup
glorious
said
miss
middleton's
father
h'm
yes
said
doubtfully
but
you
know
i'm
afraid
it
won't
last
it's
beginning
to
look
rather
like
like
hail
yes
said
miss
middleton
we
both
thought
so
exploring
come
gather
around
my
earties
and
listen
while
to
me
for
ave
yarn
to
spin
you
yarn
of
the

waggled
my
watch-chain
jaunty
which
was
jewelled
in
every
hole

always
steer
by
my
cumpas
ere
it's
pointing
straight

etukishook
gaukrodger
clegg
sir
fortescue
flannery
and
the
cardinal
merry

five
third
singles
for

and
the
cardinal
merry
del
val
we
sailed
from
wick
to
the
norrard
for
undreds
of
days
and
nights
till
we
came
at
last
to
the
ice-floes
and
followed
the
northern
lights
the
horroreo-boreo
balis
which
it
turned
us
all
orrible
pale
and
sez
to
my
men

said
etukishook
gaukrodger
clegg
sir
fortescue
flannery
and
the
cardinal
merry
del
val
twas
the
cumpas
as
went
and
found
it
it
seemed
to
have
turned
its
head
it
would
spin
like
mad
for
minute
and
then
it
would
lay
like
dead
it
took
on
just
like
wild
thing
you'd
almost
sworn
it
cried
till
at
last
it
shot
through
the
glass
and
got
right
up
on
its
end
and
died
that
proves
it
cried
etukishook
gaukrodger
clegg
sir
fortescue
flannery
and
the
cardinal
merry
del
val
we
gave
three
cheers
for
ole
england
and
we
up
with
the
union
jack
and
we
plugged
our
pipes
and
we
smoked
em
and
we
thought
about
getting
back
but
wunnerful
pride
so
filled
us
as
we
sat
on
top
of
the
ball
that
innocent
tears
the
first
for
years
rolled
out
of
the
eyes
of
all
partikerlarly
out
of
those
of
etukishook
gaukrodger
clegg
sir
fortescue
flannery
and
the
cardinal
merry
del
val
then
called
for
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
to
the
king
dear
king
i've
found
the
pole
and
i'm
tying
piece
of
it
up
with
string
i'll
send
it
round
in
the
morning
for
your
majesty's
grace
to
see
just
drop
me
wire
if
you
like
it
sire
and
i'll
collar
the
lot
signed
me
witnesses
etukishook
gaukrodger
clegg
sir
fortescue
flannery
and
the
cardinal
merry
del
val
so
that's
how
it
appened
my
earties
no
matter
what
others
may
say
did
they
see
the
pole
they
didn't
that
proves
ad
took
it
away
it's
as
true
as
i'm
standing
here
lads
as
true
as
the
daily
mail
that
was
the
first
as
nearly
burst
a-finding
the
great
big
nail
shopping
if
you
should
happen
to
be
in
regent
street
tomorrow
at
four
ran
the
assignation
just
where
what's
the
name
of
the
street
comes
into
it
and
lady
in
very
pretty
new
mauve
coat
and
skirt
bows
to
you
raise
your
hat
and
say
crisis'
and
she
will
let
you
help
her
with
her
shopping
my
guess
at
the
name
of
the
street
was
successful
raised
my
hat
and
said
good-afternoon
but
you
had
to
say
crisis
said
miss
middleton
that's
the
password
can't
i've
sworn
i'll
never
say
it
again
took
most
fearful
oath
several
people
heard
me
taking
it
and
swooned
but
how
do
know
you're
the
right
one
if
you
don't
say
it
well
suppose
shall
have
to
let
you
come
i've
just
lost
mother
she
went
in
at
the
silver
department
and
out
at
the
art
fabrics
like
people
when
they
can't
pay
for
their
hansoms
yes
that's
bad
the
accused
who
appeared
to
feel
her
position
acutely
gave
false
address
what
are
you
going
to
buy
well
thought
i'd
just
help
you
get
your
presents
first
i'm
not
giving
any
this
christmas
gave
lot
only
year
ago
oh
but
haven't
they
paid
you
any
wages
since
then
yes
few
trifling
sums
only
quick
there's
your
mother
pulled
miss
middleton
hastily
into
the
nearest
shop
and
shut
the
door
what
fun
she
said
breathlessly
mother
loves
hide-and
seek
mrs
middleton
hurried
past
covered
with
parcels
and
dived
into
another
door
it's
quite
safe
now
said
let's
go
and
what
can
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
said
soothing
voice
at
our
backs
we
turned
round
in
alarm
er
we
only
just
let
me
see
what
was
it
you
wanted
said
miss
middleton
to
me
don't
really
want
anything
was
going
to
help
you
buy
one
of
those
you
know
yes
but
i've
got
that
know
there
was
something
you
said
you
wanted
very
much
probably
tea
tiaras
explained
miss
middleton
hastily
of
course
certainly
madam
said
the
shopwalker
if
you
will
just
sit
down
he
continued
leading
us
to
little
room
out
of
the
main
stream
of
shoppers
will
send
somebody
to
attend
you
we
sat
down
mechanically
leant
my
stick
against
showcase
and
balanced
my
hat
on
the
top
of
it
now
you've
done
it
said
how
many
tiaras
shall
we
have
i've
got
nearly
four
pounds
we
needn't
have
any
we
can
say
we
don't
much
care
about
their
selection
or
that
we
wanted
one
specially
built
for
us
one
goes
into
dozens
of
shops
without
buying
anything
said
miss
middleton
cheerily
never
do
replied
gloomily
look
out
here
he
is
an
attendant
advanced
briskly
towards
us
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
tried
to
count
my
money
tiaras
madam
certainly
about
what
price
tell
him
about
three
pounds
eight
and
six
whispered
to
miss
middleton
three
pounds
nine
corrected
as
ran
another
sixpence
to
ground
here
is
beautiful
one
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
too
much
prompted
softly
oh
broke
in
miss
middleton
brightly
i'm
so
sorry
such
silly
mistake
we
wanted
neck-chains
not
tiaras
barbara
has
tiara
already
hasn't
she
she
appealed
to
me
two
said
quickly
if
not
three
i'm
so
sorry
said
miss
middleton
with
dazzling
smile
the
first
gentleman
must
have
misunderstood
of
course
we
gave
her
tiara
last
year
the
man
was
disappointed
saw
that
but
the
smile
melted
him
and
he
went
off
in
all
friendliness
tiara
doesn't
sound
very
much
like
neck-chain
remarked
after
pause
oh
don't
you
think
so
it
depends
how
you
say
it
like
beauchamp
and
cholmondeley
and
what
is
it
when
pronounced
properly
it's
chain
that
hangs
round
your
neck
and
when
you
don't
quite
know
what
to
say
to
anybody
you
play
with
it
carelessly
same
as
men
smoking
cigarettes
only
better
for
you
see
well
here
we
have
hundred
of
the
best
the
attendant
got
to
business
at
once
this
one
he
said
holding
up
rather
jolly
one
comes
out
at
ten
guineas
tell
him
whispered
to
miss
middleton
that
we've
only
come
out
with
three
that's
very
pretty
she
said
are
those
moon-stones
yes
madam
the
fashionable
stone
this
year
it's
more
for
next
year
that
we
want
it
should
say
this
season
don't
think
you
will
find
prettier
one
than
this
madam
it's
very
sweet
but
aren't
they
unlucky
unless
you
happen
to
have
been
born
in
the
right
month
she
turned
to
me
when
is
barbara's
birthday
may
said
unhesitatingly
mean
march
anyhow
said
miss
middleton
know
it's
wrong
for
moonstones
because
was
thinking
of
giving
her
some
two
years
ago
and
it
had
to
be
opals
instead
we
both
thought
of
it
said
miss
middleton
looked
at
me
so
admiringly
that
began
to
get
reckless
besides
we
don't
know
the
size
of
her
neck
went
on
and
she
never
smokes
mean
she
never
doesn't
know
what
to
say
to
anybody
so
think
we
should
be
making
mistake
if
we
gave
her
this
do
indeed
now
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
but
barbara
the
man
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
in
bewilderment
if
you
could
show
us
some
hatpins
instead
said
miss
middleton
hurriedly
before
he
could
open
his
mouth
this
is
excellent
said
as
he
retired
in
confusion
we're
working
down
well
all
we've
got
to
do
now
is
to
wait
till
he
comes
back
and
then
say
that
we're
sorry
but
we
meant
hairpins
with
hair-pins
you're
practically
there
supposing
they
only
had
gold
ones
then
we
should
point
out
that
they
wouldn't
go
with
barbara's
curiously-coloured
hair
you
leave
this
to
me
can
finish
it
off
now
on
my
head
at
the
same
time
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
going
to
spend
anything
oh
but
you
are
said
miss
middleton
you're
going
to
give
me
and
mother
tea
of
course
am
agreed
after
tea
went
back
to
the
shop
by
myself
want
said
trifle
for
about
three
pounds
moonstone
pendant
or
something
yes
that's
very
sweet
no
i'll
take
it
with
me
they
packed
it
in
pretty
little
box
for
me
and
i'm
going
to
send
it
to
miss
middleton
on
the
twenty-fourth
am
putting
in
card
with
the
words
from
barbara
on
it
as
said
am
not
giving
any
presents
myself
this
year
but
do
think
that
barbara
should
repay
at
least
some
of
the
kindnesses
which
have
been
showered
upon
her
so
wantonly
chess
the
author
cannot
lay
claim
to
any
great
technical
knowledge
of
chess
but
he
fancies
that
he
understands
the
spirit
of
the
game
he
feels
that
after
the
many
poems
on
the
boat
race
few
bracing
lines
on
the
inter-university
chess
match
would
be
welcome
change
this
is
the
ballad
of
edward
bray
captain
of
catherine's
cambridge
blue
oh
no
one
ever
had
just
his
way
of
huffing
bishop
with
kb
the
day
breaks
fine
and
the
evenings
brings
worthy
foe
in
the
oxford
man
great
finesser
with
pawns
and
things
but
quick
in
the
loose
when
the
game
began
the
board
was
set
and
the
rivals
tossed
but
fortune
alas
was
oxford's
friend
tail
cried
edward
and
edward
lost
so
oxford
played
from
the
fireplace
end
we
hold
our
breath
for
the
game's
begun
oh
who
so
gallant
as
edward
bray
he's
taken
bishop
from
kq
and
ruffed
it
just
in
the
cambridge
way
then
oxford
castles
his
qb
knight
he
follows
the
old
old
oxford
groove
though
never
gambit
saw
the
light
that's
able
to
cope
with
edward's
move
the
game
went
on
and
the
game
was
fast
oh
oxford
huffed
and
his
king
was
crowned
the
exchange
was
lost
and
pawn
was
passed
and
under
the
table
knight
was
found
then
oxford
chuckled
but
edward
swore
horrible
horrible
oath
swore
he
and
landed
him
one
on
the
qb
and
followed
it
up
with
an
rq
time
was
called
with
an
air
of
pride
up
to
his
feet
rose
edward
bray
marker
what
of
the
score
he
cried
what
of
the
battle
i've
won
this
day
the
score
was
counted
and
bray
had
won
by
two
in
honours
and
four
by
tricks
and
half
of
bishop
that
came
undone
and
all
of
bishop
on
kq
then
here's
to
chess
and
cheer
again
for
the
man
who
fought
on
an
april
day
with
never
thought
of
sordid
gain
england's
proud
of
you
edward
bray
progressive
bridge
there
were
twelve
tables
numbered
up
to
well
twelve
of
them
and
started
at
because
my
name
is
ernest
our
host
arranged
us
and
of
course
he
may
have
had
quite
another
scheme
in
his
mind
if
so
it
was
an
extraordinary
coincidence
that
my
partner's
name
was
ethel
she
herself
swore
it
was
millicent
but
doubt
if
one
can
trust
woman
in
these
matters
she
looked
just
like
an
ethel
had
never
seen
her
before
shall
never
see
her
again
but
she
will
always
be
ethel
to
me
there
is
only
one
rule
at
progressive
bridge
and
that
is
if
you
lose
you
go
to
the
next
table
and
if
you
win
you
stay
where
you
are
in
any
case
you
get
fresh
partner
each
time
that
being
so
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
ask
ethel
what
she
discarded
from
as
it
happened
though
she
began
it
discard
from
strength
she
said
so
do
agreed
gladly
we
already
had
lot
in
common
great
strength
returns
the
penny
added
what's
that
moderate
strength
rings
the
bell
it's
sort
of
formula
say
to
myself
and
brings
luck
may
play
to
hearts
ethel
discarded
small
heart
on
the
first
round
of
clubs
and
small
club
on
the
first
round
of
hearts
after
which
systematically
and
together
we
discarded
from
great
weakness
what
with
the
revoke
and
other
things
they
scored
hundreds
and
thousands
that
game
you
know
where
providence
goes
wrong
said
is
in
over-estimating
our
skill
providence
thinks
too
highly
of
us
it
thinks
that
if
it
gives
us
knave
and
two
tens
between
us
we
can
get
grand
slam
yes
and
think
think
perhaps
that
just
the
least
little
bit
it
underrates
dorothy's
abilities
indeed
said
dorothy
was
the
person
who
had
just
taken
two
hundred
and
ninety-eight
off
us
yes
you
see
dorothy
has
played
before
and
don't
think
providence
knew
it
rather
looks
like
that
mind
said
ethel
graciously
don't
blame
providence
for
not
knowing
dorothy
laughed
and
cut
for
me
dealt
myself
three
aces
and
went
no
trumps
to
my
surprise
dorothy's
partner
doubled
and
led
the
ace
of
hearts
one
moment
said
and
took
it
up
and
looked
at
the
back
of
it
then
looked
at
the
back
of
my
own
ace
of
hearts
then
looked
at
the
front
of
it
again
and
swore
very
softly
and
played
it
i'm
very
sorry
apologised
at
the
end
of
the
game
had
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing
an
ass
in
lion's
skin
you
saw
me
play
the
three
of
hearts
well
do
you
know
it's
very
sad
he
actually
pretended
to
be
the
ace
hid
his
head
behind
one
card
and
his
feet
behind
another
and
only
well
thought
it
was
the
ace
at
the
end
of
the
round
ethel
and
moved
on
good-bye
said
to
dorothy
like
watching
you
play
if
you
wait
here
shall
be
round
again
soon
my
next
partner
was
called
aggie
ethel
addressed
her
as
mary
but
she
was
much
too
lively
for
mary
had
never
seen
her
before
shall
never
see
her
again
but
she
will
always
be
aggie
to
me
she
began
at
once
discard
from
weakness
partner
like
hearts
led
never
go
spades
on
my
own
live
on
tapioca
and
toadstools
and
the
consequence
was
it's
the
same
with
me
said
except
about
tapioca
don't
like
tapioca
in
fact
always
er
discard
from
tapioca
otherwise
we
agree
it's
your
deal
now
said
to
ethel
we
shall
see
what
providence
thinks
of
our
comparative
merits
providence
made
no
mistake
in
the
whole
round
my
partner
and
scored
once
only
chicane
in
spades
moved
on
to
should
never
see
ethel
again
always
play
the
canadian
discard
said
violet
and
like
spades
led
need
hardly
say
that
aggie
whom
ethel
called
mary
spoke
of
violet
as
diana
but
she
looked
much
more
like
violet
and
she
will
always
be
violet
to
me
had
never
seen
her
before
though
and
shall
never
see
her
again
so
do
said
do
you
know
canada
at
all
always
wish
had
been
there
go
good
deal
to
switzerland
said
violet
are
you
fond
of
bridge
no
never
that
is
mean
very
shall
we
cut
the
canadian
discard
hardly
does
itself
justice
under
that
name
it
is
no
mere
discard
but
embraces
all
the
finer
points
of
bridge
it
leads
through
weakness
and
blocks
your
partner's
long
suits
and
trumps
his
tricks
and
though
couldn't
discover
any
recognised
system
about
it
revokes
now
and
then
too
from
tact
or
sympathy
or
some
such
motive
played
the
canadian
discard
for
all
was
worth
we
got
to
without
any
difficulty
and
may
be
passed
by
for
nothing
happened
there
for
some
reason
was
left
out
or
rather
run
into
cannot
understand
the
point
of
this
to
every
man
his
table
and
feel
convinced
that
should
have
done
remarkably
well
at
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
all
the
evening
don't
much
care
about
betting
but
am
prepared
to
wager
hundred
pounds
that
should
have
got
grand
slam
at
it
was
somewhere
down
in
the
x's
that
met
maud
had
been
round
don't
know
how
many
times
and
was
feeling
quite
giddy
alice
elizabeth
iris
mabel
they
were
all
forgotten
when
came
to
play
with
maud
hepzibah
on
my
right
called
her
millicent
or
something
like
that
but
knew
really
that
her
name
must
be
maud
had
never
seen
her
before
shall
never
see
her
again
but
she
will
always
be
maud
to
me
discard
from
hearts
said
like
my
weakest
suit
led
have
revoked
three
times
this
evening
at
table
on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
fireplace
played
the
canadian
discard
and
shall
never
play
it
again
at
as
you
go
round
the
lamp
had
four
aces
and
my
partner
went
spades
i've
had
rotten
luck
all
through
and
i'm
enjoying
myself
very
much
shall
we
be
very
cautious
or
would
you
like
to
play
dashing
game
oh
let's
dash
said
maud
dealt
and
went
no
trumps
on
two
aces
to
my
great
surprise
hepzibah's
partner
doubled
and
led
the
ace
of
clubs
one
moment
said
and
took
it
up
and
looked
at
the
back
of
it
then
looked
at
the
back
of
my
own
ace
of
clubs
then
looked
at
the
front
of
it
and
swore
very
softly
and
played
it
i'm
very
sorry
began
at
the
end
of
the
game
but
haven't
we
met
before
said
maud
with
smile
looked
at
her
hard
by
jove
ethel
cried
my
name's
millicent
said
maud
and
seeing
that
we
met
for
the
first
time
few
hours
ago
yes
you
were
my
first
partner
ethel
i'm
sorry
who
is
ethel
beg
your
pardon
apologised
but
always
call
my
first
partner
at
progressive
bridge
ethel
it's
sort
of
hobby
with
me
see
said
maud
mean
ethel
well
suppose
must
call
her
millicent
now
though
had
never
seen
her
before
and
shall
never
see
her
again
she
will
always
be
millicent
to
me
dressing
up
at
pageant
our
episode
is
the
tenth
and
last
and
may
add
unofficially
the
most
important
the
period
of
it
is
in
order
to
lead
up
to
it
properly
it
has
been
found
necessary
to
start
the
first
episode
at
this
gives
the
audience
time
to
get
hungry
for
us
at
last
they
say
when
we
come
on
this
is
the
end
maria
the
duchess
of
kirkcudbright
says
that
they
don't
say
that
at
all
they
say
why
henry
it's
had
no
idea
how
the
time
flies
when
you
are
enjoying
yourself
we
must
stay
to
the
end
few
minutes
won't
make
any
difference
now
and
it's
only
cold
mutton
must
explain
that
it
is
the
duchess
of
kirkcudbright
and
do
remember
the
because
she
is
very
particular
about
it
who
in
this
episode
condescends
to
dance
minuet
with
me
that
stately
old
measure
if
you
don't
trip
over
the
sand-hill
opposite
block
which
so
delighted
our
forefathers
it
is
very
sad
thing
but
though
the
whole
pageant
as
have
explained
hinges
upon
us
yet
our
names
and
description
do
not
appear
upon
the
programme
we
are
put
down
briefly
and
think
libellously
as
revellers
however
we
learnt
that
we
were
really
people
of
some
position
right
in
the
smart
set
by
all
accounts
so
decided
to
be
lord
tunbridge
wells
and
my
partner
the
duchess
of
kirkcudbright
that
is
just
like
her
to
be
whole
county
when
am
only
watering-place
we
are
supposed
to
do
the
revelling
as
soon
as
we
come
in
as
lead
my
partner
down
the
steps
say
to
her
our
revel
think
and
she
replies
shall
we
revel
or
shall
we
sit
it
out
after
little
discussion
we
decide
to
revel
partly
because
there
is
nowhere
to
sit
down
and
partly
because
the
prompter
has
his
eye
on
us
now
don't
know
what
your
idea
of
revelling
is
but
mine
would
include
at
the
very
least
small
ginger
ale
and
slice
of
seed-cake
mean
don't
think
that
would
be
overdoing
it
at
all
but
do
you
suppose
we
are
allowed
this
or
indeed
anything
not
likely
and
yet
it
is
just
little
touch
of
that
sort
which
gives
verisimilitude
to
whole
pageant
before
we
have
really
got
through
our
revelling
the
band
strikes
up
and
suddenly
we
are
all
in
our
places
for
the
minuet
now
although
you
have
paid
your
two
guineas
like
man
and
are
sitting
in
the
very
front
row
you
mustn't
think
we
have
taken
all
this
trouble
of
learning
the
minuet
simply
to
amuse
you
not
at
all
we
are
doing
it
for
the
sake
of
king
george
the
second
no
less
command
performance
and
so
when
we
are
all
in
line
just
ready
to
start
and
whisper
to
my
partner
say
i'm
awfully
sorry
but
i've
forgotten
the
minuet
let's
do
the
lancers
instead
she
whispers
back
quick
george
is
looking
at
me
is
my
patch
on
straight
no
say
now
don't
forget
you
have
to
smile
all
the
time
hallo
we're
off
am
not
going
to
describe
the
dance
to
you
because
it
is
too
difficult
but
may
say
briefly
that
there's
whole
lot
of
things
you
do
with
your
feet
and
another
whole
lot
with
your
hands
that
you
have
to
sway
your
body
about
in
an
easy
and
graceful
manner
that
you
must
keep
one
eye
on
the
ground
to
see
that
you
don't
fall
over
the
sandhills
and
another
eye
on
your
partner
to
see
that
she
is
doing
it
all
right
and
the
two
of
you
joint
eye
on
everybody
else
to
see
that
the
affair
is
going
symmetrically
and
then
then
comes
the
final
instruction
don't
look
anxious
smile
and
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourself
so
far
have
resisted
the
inclination
to
smile
the
fact
is
that
when
cast
aside
my
usual
habiliments
and
take
upon
me
the
personality
of
another
like
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
part
now
will
put
the
case
before
you
and
you
shall
say
whether
am
not
right
here
we
have
as
conceive
the
situation
sprig
of
the
nobility
tunbridge
wells
he
is
modest
young
man
who
spends
most
of
his
time
at
his
lovely
kentish
seat
flanked
by
fine
old
forest
trees
preferring
the
quiet
of
the
country
to
the
noise
and
bustle
of
london
one
day
however
he
ventures
up
to
town
and
looking
in
at
his
customary
coffee-house
is
hailed
by
an
acquaintance
tunbridge
wells
may
mention
is
beautifully
attired
in
long
blue
coat
white
satin
waistcoat
fancy
breeches
with
quaint
designs
painted
on
them
silk
stockings
and
shoes
which
are
too
small
for
him
what
are
you
doing
to-night
says
his
friend
come
down
to
chelsea
with
me
there's
grand
venetian
te
on
and
old
george
will
be
there
right
says
tunbridge
wells
when
they
get
to
the
gardens
his
friend
takes
him
aside
say
he
begins
anxiously
hope
you
won't
mind
but
the
fact
is
that
i've
promised
you
shall
dance
in
minuet
to-night
old
george
particularly
wants
to
see
one
but
simply
couldn't
says
tunbridge
wells
in
alarm
can't
you
get
somebody
else
oh
but
you
must
i've
got
you
jolly
partner
the
duchess
of
kirkcudbright
you
know
the
minuet
of
course
well
i've
learnt
it
but
i've
very
nearly
forgotten
it
again
and
my
shoes
are
beastly
uncomfortable
before
the
king
too
it's
bit
steep
you
know
well
then
you
will
good
man
no
no
cries
tunbridge
wells
hastily
and
leads
his
friend
aside
under
the
trees
say
he
begins
mysteriously
don't
say
anything
but
well
it's
rather
awkward
may
as
well
tell
you
these
er
these
things
are
bit
tight
they
look
all
right
like
this
you
know
but
when
you
bend
down
well
mean
have
to
be
jolly
careful
was
just
thinking
how
pretty
they
were
beautiful
thing
that
he
adds
pointing
to
crescent
moon
in
blue
on
tunbridge
wells'
left
knee
don't
touch
says
wells
in
alarm
it
comes
off
like
anything
lost
dragon-fly
only
yesterday
well
you
see
how
it
is
old
man
but
for
them
should
have
loved
it
only
say
don't
be
fool
your
servant
duchess
was
just
saying
yes
am
devoted
to
it
yes
yes
let's
see
it
is
the
left
foot
isn't
it
confound
that
idiot
now
then
do
you
wonder
that
the
poor
fellow
looks
anxious
or
that
feel
it
my
duty
as
good
actor
to
look
anxious
too
have
promised
not
to
describe
the
whole
minuet
to
you
but
must
mention
one
figure
in
it
of
which
am
particularly
fond
in
this
you
rejoin
your
partner
after
long
absence
and
you
have
once
more
her
supporting
hand
to
hold
you
up
for
some
hours
previously
you
have
been
alone
in
the
wild
and
undulating
open
tripping
over
molehills
and
falling
down
ha-has
and
it
is
very
pleasant
especially
when
your
shoes
fit
you
too
soon
to
get
back
to
her
and
pour
all
your
troubles
into
her
sympathetic
ear
it's
figure
in
which
you
stand
on
one
foot
each
for
considerable
time
and
paw
the
air
with
the
others
you
preserve
your
balance
better
if
you
converse
easily
and
naturally
nearly
came
frightful
purler
just
now
did
you
see
h'sh
not
so
loud
have
you
found
mother
yet
she's
here
to-day
one
of
my
patches
fell
off
hope
nobody
heard
it
you've
got
different
wig
to-day
why
it's
greyer
had
such
very
anxious
moment
yesterday
you
know
that
last
bow
at
the
end
where
you
go
down
and
stay
under
water
for
about
five
minutes
well
really
thought
however
they
didn't
don't
like
you
in
this
one
it
doesn't
suit
you
at
all
so
thought
at
first
but
if
you
gaze
at
it
very
earnestly
for
three
hours
and
then
look
up
at
the
ceiling
you
why
there
is
mother
hold
up
fancy
we
have
rather
good
action
in
this
figure
do
you
think
she's
noticing
it
hope
she
knows
that
we
could
stand
on
one
leg
without
moving
the
other
one
at
all
mean
don't
want
her
to
think
hallo
here
we
are
good-bye
see
you
again
in
the
next
figure
but
one
and
the
duchess
of
kirkcudbright
trips
off
put
in
the
because
she
is
very
particular
about
it
and
say
trips
because
know
the
ground
ii
at
dance
then
you
really
are
coming
said
queen
elizabeth
as
she
gave
me
my
third
cup
of
tea
yes
really
am
sighed
what
as
don't
know
at
all
something
with
cold
leave
it
to
you
partner
only
don't
go
black
suit
what
about
richelieu
should
never
be
able
to
pronounce
that
confessed
besides
always
think
that
these
great
scientists
should
say
philos
that
is
of
course
that
these
generals
er
which
room
is
the
encyclop
dia
in
you
might
go
as
one
of
the
kings
of
england
which
is
your
favourite
king
william
and
mary
now
that
would
be
an
original
costume
should
have
don't
be
ridiculous
why
not
henry
viii
do
you
think
should
get
lot
of
partners
as
henry
viii
anyhow
don't
think
it's
very
becoming
figure
but
you
don't
wear
fancy
dress
simply
because
it's
becoming
well
that
is
rather
the
point
to
settle
are
we
going
to
enhance
my
natural
beauty
or
would
you
like
it
er
toned
down
little
of
course
could
go
as
the
dog-faced
man
only
very
well
then
if
you
don't
like
henry
what
about
edward
but
why
do
you
want
to
thrust
royalty
on
me
i'd
much
sooner
go
as
perkin
warbeck
should
wear
brown
perkin
jerkin
jack
is
going
as
sir
walter
raleigh
then
shall
certainly
touch
him
for
cigarette
said
as
got
up
to
go
it
was
week
later
that
met
elizabeth
in
bond
street
well
she
said
have
you
got
your
things
haven't
confessed
forget
who
you
said
you
were
going
as
somebody
who
had
black
hair
said
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
should
have
knocked
them
rather
if
had
had
black
hair
instead
of
curly
eyes
and
blue
hair
can
you
think
of
anybody
for
me
queen
elizabeth
regarded
me
as
sternly
as
she
might
have
regarded
well
i'm
not
very
good
at
history
do
you
mean
to
say
she
said
at
last
that
that
is
as
far
as
you
have
got
somebody
who
had
black
hair
hang
it
protested
it's
something
to
have
been
measured
for
the
wig
have
you
been
measured
for
your
wig
well
er
no
that
is
to
say
not
exactly
what
you
might
call
measured
but
well
the
fact
is
was
just
going
along
now
only
say
where
do
get
wig
you've
done
nothing
said
elizabeth
absolutely
nothing
say
don't
say
that
began
nervously
i've
done
an
awful
lot
really
i've
practically
got
the
costume
i'm
going
as
harold
the
boy
earl
or
jessica's
last
hallo
there's
my
bus
i've
got
cold
mustn't
keep
it
waiting
good-bye
and
fled
am
going
said
as
julius
sar
he
was
practically
bald
think
how
cool
that
will
be
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
elizabeth
that
you
have
altered
again
don't
be
rough
with
me
or
shall
cry
i've
got
an
awful
cold
then
you've
no
business
to
go
as
julius
sar
say
now
you're
trying
to
unsettle
me
and
was
going
to-morrow
to
order
the
clothes
what
you
haven't
was
really
going
this
afternoon
only
only
it's
early
closing
day
besides
wanted
to
see
if
my
cold
would
get
better
because
if
it
didn't
look
here
i'll
be
frank
with
you
am
going
as
charlemagne
oh
charlemagne
in
half-mourning
because
pepin
the
short
had
just
died
something
quiet
in
grey
with
stripe
thought
only
half-mourning
because
he
only
got
half
the
throne
by-the
way
suppose
all
these
people
wore
pumps
and
white
kid
gloves
all
right
yes
thought
so
wonder
if
charlemagne
really
had
black
hair
anyhow
they
can't
prove
he
didn't
seeing
when
he
lived
he
flourished
about
you
know
as
matter
of
fact
wasn't
actually
his
most
flourishing
year
because
the
radicals
were
in
power
then
and
land
went
down
so
now
yes
or
else
as
raymond
blathwayt
anyhow
added
indignantly
minute
later
swear
i'm
going
somehow
hallo
said
cheerfully
as
ran
into
her
majesty
in
piccadilly
i've
just
been
ordering
that
is
to
say
i've
been
going
mean
i'm
just
going
to
let's
see
it's
next
week
isn't
it
for
moment
elizabeth
was
speechless
not
at
all
my
idea
of
the
character
now
then
she
said
at
last
am
going
to
take
you
in
hand
will
you
trust
yourself
entirely
to
me
to
the
death
your
majesty
i'm
sickening
for
something
as
it
is
how
tall
are
you
oh
more
than
that
said
quickly
gent's
large
medium
am
then
i'll
order
costume
for
you
and
have
it
sent
round
there's
no
need
for
you
to
be
anything
historical
you
might
be
butcher
quite
blue
is
my
colour
in
fact
can
do
you
the
best
end
of
the
neck
at
tenpence
madam
if
you'll
wait
moment
while
sharpen
the
knife
let's
see
you
like
it
cut
on
the
cross
think
bother
they've
forgotten
the
strop
well
it
may
not
be
butcher
said
elizabeth
it
depends
what
they've
got
that
was
week
ago
this
morning
was
really
ill
at
last
had
hardly
any
breakfast
simply
couldn't
look
poached
egg
in
the
yolk
day
on
the
sofa
in
darkened
room
and
bed
at
seven
o'clock
was
my
programme
and
then
my
eye
caught
great
box
of
clothes
and
remembered
that
the
dance
was
to-night
opened
the
box
perhaps
dressed
soberly
as
black-haired
butcher
could
look
in
for
an
hour
or
two
and
help
yellow
waistcoat
pink
breeches
and
no
it's
not
an
eider-down
it's
coat
yellow
pink
br
am
going
as
joseph
am
going
as
swan
edgar
am
going
as
the
sick
duke
by
orchardson
am
going
yes
that's
it
am
going
back
to
bed
after
dinner
the
complete
kitchen
wat
in
the
drawing-room
after
dinner
with
my
knees
together
and
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
waited
for
the
game
to
be
explained
to
me
there's
pencil
for
you
said
somebody
thank
you
very
much
said
and
put
it
carefully
away
evidently
had
won
forfeit
already
it
wasn't
very
good
pencil
though
now
has
everybody
got
pencils
asked
somebody
else
the
game
is
called
furnishing
kitchen
it's
quite
easy
will
somebody
think
of
letter
she
turned
to
me
perhaps
you'd
better
certainly
said
and
immediately
thought
very
hard
of
these
thought-reading
games
are
called
different
things
but
they
are
all
the
same
really
and
don't
believe
in
any
of
them
well
said
everybody
what
yes
have
go
on
oh
beg
your
pardon
said
in
confusion
thought
you
is
the
letter
or
smiled
knowingly
to
myself
my
godfather
and
my
godmother
went
on
cautiously
it
was
interrupted
somebody
now
then
you've
got
five
minutes
in
which
to
write
down
everything
you
can
beginning
with
go
and
they
all
started
to
write
like
anything
took
my
pencil
out
and
began
to
think
know
it
sounds
an
easy
game
to
you
now
as
you
sit
at
your
desk
surrounded
by
dictionaries
but
when
you
are
squeezed
on
to
the
edge
of
sofa
given
very
blunt
pencil
and
thin
piece
of
paper
and
challenged
to
write
in
five
minutes
on
your
knees
all
the
words
you
can
think
of
beginning
with
certain
letter
well
it
is
another
matter
altogether
thought
of
no
end
of
things
which
started
with
or
even
thought
of
rhinoceros
which
is
very
long
word
and
starts
with
but
as
for
looked
at
my
watch
and
groaned
one
minute
gone
must
keep
calm
said
and
in
bold
hand
wrote
napoleon
then
after
moment's
thought
added
nitro-glycerine
and
nats
this
is
splendid
told
myself
notting
hill
nobody
and
noon
that
makes
six
at
six
stuck
for
two
minutes
did
worse
than
that
in
fact
for
suddenly
remembered
that
gnats
were
spelt
with
however
decided
to
leave
them
in
case
nobody
else
remembered
and
on
the
fourth
minute
added
non-sequitur
time
said
somebody
just
moment
said
everybody
they
wrote
down
another
word
or
two
which
isn't
fair
and
then
began
to
add
up
i've
got
thirty
said
one
thirty-two
twenty-five
good
heavens
said
i've
only
got
seven
there
was
shout
of
laughter
then
you'd
better
begin
said
somebody
read
them
out
coughed
doubtfully
and
began
napoleon
there
was
another
shout
of
laughter
am
afraid
we
can't
allow
that
why
ever
not
asked
in
amazement
well
you'd
hardly
find
him
in
kitchen
would
you
took
out
handkerchief
and
wiped
my
brow
don't
want
to
find
him
in
kitchen
said
nervously
why
should
as
matter
of
fact
he's
dead
don't
see
what
the
kitchen's
got
to
do
with
it
kitchens
begin
with
but
the
game
is
called
furnishing
kitchen
you
have
to
make
list
of
things
beginning
with
which
you
would
find
in
kitchen
you
understood
that
didn't
you
y-y
yes
said
oh
y-y
y-yes
of
course
so
napoleon
pulled
myself
together
with
great
effort
you
don't
understand
said
with
dignity
the
cook's
name
was
napoleon
cooks
aren't
called
napoleon
said
everybody
this
one
was
carrie
napoleon
her
mistress
was
just
as
surprised
at
first
as
you
were
but
carrie
assured
her
that
no
i'm
afraid
we
can't
allow
it
i'm
sorry
said
i'm
wrong
about
that
her
name
was
carrie
smith
but
her
young
man
was
soldier
and
she
had
bought
life
of
napoleon'
for
birthday
present
for
him
it
stood
on
the
dresser
it
did
really
waiting
for
her
next
sunday
out
oh
oh
well
suppose
that
is
possible
go
on
gnats
went
on
nervously
and
hastily
of
course
know
that
gnats
are
spelt
with
they
shrieked
these
weren't
they
had
lost
the
when
they
were
quite
young
and
consequently
couldn't
bite
at
all
and
cook
said
that
no
i'm
afraid
not
i'm
sorry
said
resignedly
had
about
forty
of
them
on
the
dresser
if
you
won't
allow
any
of
them
it
pulls
me
down
lot
er
then
we
have
nitro-glycerine
there
was
another
howl
of
derision
not
at
all
said
haughtily
cook
had
chapped
hands
very
badly
and
she
went
to
the
chemist's
one
evening
for
little
glycerine
the
chemist
was
out
and
his
assistant
very
nervous
young
fellow
gave
her
nitro-glycerine
by
mistake
it
stood
on
the
dresser
it
did
really
well
said
everybody
very
reluctantly
suppose
went
on
hastily
that's
two
then
nobody
of
course
you
might
easily
find
nobody
in
the
kitchen
in
fact
you
would
pretty
often
should
say
three
the
next
is
noon
it
could
be
noon
in
the
kitchen
as
well
as
anywhere
else
don't
be
narrow-minded
about
that
all
right
go
on
non-sequitur
said
doubtfully
what
on
earth
it's
little
difficult
to
explain
but
the
idea
is
this
at
most
restaurants
you
can
get
second
help
of
anything
for
half-price
and
that
is
technically
called
follow
now
if
they
didn't
give
you
follow
that
would
be
non-sequitur
you
do
see
that
don't
you
there
was
deadly
silence
five
said
cheerfully
the
last
is
notting
hill
must
confess
said
magnanimously
that
am
bit
doubtful
whether
you
would
actually
find
notting
hill
in
kitchen
you
don't
say
so
yes
my
feeling
is
that
you
would
be
more
likely
to
find
the
kitchen
in
notting
hill
on
the
other
hand
it
is
just
possible
that
as
calais
was
found
engraven
on
mary's
heart
so
supposing
the
cook
died
oh
very
well
then
it
remains
at
five
of
course
you
think
that
as
only
had
five
came
out
last
but
you
are
wrong
there
is
pleasing
rule
in
this
game
that
if
you
have
any
word
in
your
list
which
somebody
else
has
you
cannot
count
it
and
as
all
the
others
had
the
obvious
things
such
as
nutmeg-grater
or
neck
of
mutton
or
nomelette
my
five
won
easily
and
you
will
note
that
if
only
had
been
allowed
to
count
my
gnats
it
would
have
been
forty-five
ii
getting
the
needle
he
was
pale
enthusiastic
young
man
of
the
name
of
simms
and
he
held
forth
to
us
at
great
length
about
his
latest
hobby
now
i'll
just
show
you
little
experiment
he
wound
up
one
that
have
never
known
to
fail
first
of
all
want
you
to
hide
needle
somewhere
while
am
out
of
the
room
you
must
stick
it
where
it
can
be
seen
on
chair
or
on
the
floor
if
you
like
then
shall
come
back
and
find
it
oh
mr
simms
we
all
said
now
which
one
of
you
has
the
strongest
will
we
pushed
jack
forward
jack
is
at
any
rate
big
man
very
well
shall
want
you
to
take
my
hand
when
come
in
and
look
steadily
at
the
needle
concentrate
all
your
thoughts
on
it
on
the
other
hand
shall
make
my
mind
perfect
blank
then
your
thoughts
will
gradually
pass
into
my
brain
and
shall
feel
myself
as
it
were
dragged
in
the
direction
of
the
needle
and
shall
feel
myself
as
it
were
dragged
after
you
said
jack
yes
you
mustn't
put
any
strain
on
my
arm
at
all
let
me
go
just
where
like
only
will
me
to
go
in
the
right
direction
now
then
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
put
it
hastily
back
and
said
first
shall
want
to
borrow
handkerchief
or
something
well
we
blindfolded
him
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
then
muriel
got
needle
which
after
some
discussion
was
stuck
into
the
back
of
the
chesterfield
simms
returned
and
took
jack's
left
hand
they
stood
there
together
jack
frowning
earnestly
at
the
needle
and
simms
swaying
uncertainly
at
the
knees
suddenly
his
knees
went
in
altogether
and
he
made
little
zig-zag
dash
across
the
room
as
though
he
were
taking
cover
jack
lumbered
after
him
instinctively
bending
his
head
too
they
were
brought
up
by
the
piano
which
simms
struck
with
great
force
we
all
laughed
and
jack
apologised
you
told
me
to
let
you
go
where
you
liked
you
know
he
said
yes
yes
said
simms
rather
peevishly
but
you
should
have
willed
me
not
to
hit
the
piano
as
he
spoke
he
tripped
over
small
stool
and
flinging
out
an
arm
to
save
himself
swept
two
photograph
frames
off
an
occasional
table
by
jove
said
jack
that's
jolly
good
saw
you
were
going
to
do
that
and
willed
that
the
flower
vase
should
be
spared
i'm
getting
on
think
you
had
better
start
from
the
door
again
suggested
then
you
can
get
clear
run
they
took
up
their
original
positions
you
must
think
hard
please
said
simms
again
my
mind
is
perfect
blank
and
yet
can
feel
nothing
coming
jack
made
terrible
faces
at
the
needle
then
without
warning
simms
flopped
on
to
the
floor
at
full
length
pulling
jack
after
him
you
mustn't
mind
if
do
that
he
said
getting
up
slowly
no
said
jack
dusting
himself
felt
irresistibly
compelled
to
go
down
said
simms
so
did
said
jack
the
needle
is
very
often
hidden
in
the
floor
you
see
you
are
sure
you
are
looking
at
it
they
were
in
corner
with
their
backs
to
it
and
jack
after
trying
in
vain
to
get
it
over
his
right
shoulder
or
his
left
bent
down
and
focussed
it
between
his
legs
this
must
have
connected
the
current
for
simms
turned
right
round
and
marched
up
to
the
needle
there
he
said
triumphantly
taking
off
the
bandage
we
all
clapped
while
jack
poured
himself
out
whisky
simms
turned
to
him
you
have
very
strong
will
indeed
he
said
one
of
the
strongest
have
met
now
would
one
of
the
ladies
like
to
try
oh
i'm
sure
couldn't
said
all
the
ladies
should
like
to
do
it
again
said
simms
modestly
perhaps
you
sir
all
right
i'll
try
said
when
simms
was
outside
told
them
my
idea
i'll
hold
the
needle
in
my
other
hand
said
and
then
can
always
look
at
it
easily
and
it
will
always
be
in
different
place
which
ought
to
muddle
him
we
fetched
him
in
and
he
took
my
left
hand
no
it's
no
good
he
said
at
last
don't
seem
to
get
it
let
me
try
the
other
hand
had
no
time
to
warn
him
he
clasped
the
other
hand
firmly
and
from
the
shriek
that
followed
it
seemed
that
he
got
it
there
ensued
the
perfect
blank
that
he
had
insisted
on
all
the
evening
then
he
pulled
off
the
bandage
and
showed
very
angry
face
well
we
explained
how
accidental
it
was
and
begged
him
to
try
again
he
refused
rather
sulkily
suddenly
jack
said
believe
could
do
it
blindfold
miss
muriel
will
you
look
at
the
needle
and
see
if
you
can
will
me
simms
bucked
up
bit
and
seemed
keen
on
the
idea
so
jack
was
blindfolded
the
needle
hid
and
muriel
took
his
hand
now
is
your
mind
perfect
blank
said
simms
to
jack
it
always
is
said
jack
very
well
then
you
ought
soon
to
feel
in
dreamy
state
as
though
you
were
in
another
world
miss
muriel
you
must
think
only
of
the
needle
jack
held
her
hand
tight
and
looked
most
idiotically
peaceful
after
three
minutes
simms
spoke
again
well
he
said
eagerly
i've
got
the
dreamy
other-world
state
perfectly
said
jack
and
then
he
gave
at
the
knees
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
this
is
silly
said
muriel
trying
to
get
her
hand
away
jack
staggered
violently
and
gripped
her
hand
again
please
miss
muriel
implored
simms
feel
sure
he
is
just
going
to
do
it
jack
staggered
again
sawed
the
air
with
his
disengaged
hand
and
then
turned
right
round
and
marched
for
the
door
dragging
muriel
behind
him
the
door
slammed
after
them
there
is
little
trick
of
sitting
on
chair
and
picking
pin
out
of
it
with
the
teeth
started
simms
who
was
all
eagerness
to
follow
the
pair
and
find
out
the
mysterious
force
that
was
drawing
them
upon
this
trick
for
jack
is
one
of
my
best
friends
when
jack
and
muriel
came
back
from
the
billiard-room
and
announced
that
they
were
engaged
simms
was
on
his
back
on
the
floor
with
the
chair
on
the
top
of
him
explaining
for
the
fourth
time
that
if
the
thing
had
not
overbalanced
at
the
critical
moment
he
would
have
secured
the
object
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
this
view
bachelor
days
the
butter
you
mustn't
think
am
afraid
of
my
housekeeper
not
at
all
frequently
meet
her
on
the
stairs
and
give
her
some
such
order
as
think
if
you
don't
mind
might
have
breakfast
just
little
later
er
yes
about
eight
o'clock
yes
thank
you
or
ring
the
bell
and
say
want-my
boots
we
both
recognise
that
it
is
mine
to
command
and
hers
to
obey
but
in
the
matter
of
the
butter
have
let
things
slide
until
the
position
is
rapidly
becoming
an
untenable
one
yet
doubt
if
man
of
imagination
and
feeling
could
have
acted
otherwise
given
the
initial
error
however
you
shall
hear
there
are
two
sorts
of
butter
salt
and
fresh
now
nobody
is
so
fond
of
butter
as
am
but
butter
as
have
often
told
everybody
isn't
butter
at
all
unless
it
is
salt
the
other
kind
is
merely
an
inferior
vaseline
the
sort
of
thing
you
put
on
the
axles
of
locomotives
imagine
then
my
disgust
when
took
my
first
breakfast
in
these
rooms
eleven
months
ago
to
find
that
the
housekeeper
had
provided
me
with
large
lump
of
vaseline
hate
waste
in
small
things
take
care
of
the
little
extravagances
say
and
the
big
ones
will
take
care
of
themselves
my
first
thought
on
viewing
this
pat
of
butter
was
it
is
difficult
but
will
eat
it
my
second
but
must
tell
the
housekeeper
to
get
salt
butter
next
time
an
ordinary-minded
person
would
have
stopped
there
went
one
further
my
third
thought
was
this
housekeepers
are
forgetful
creatures
if
tell
her
now
she
will
never
remember
obviously
had
better
wait
until
this
pound
is
just
finished
and
she
is
about
to
get
in
some
more
then
will
be
the
time
to
speak
so
waited
and
it
was
here
that
made
my
mistake
for
it
turned
out
that
it
was
who
was
the
forgetful
creature
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
got
up
to
find
another
large
pound
of
vaseline
on
my
table
the
next
fortnight
went
by
slowly
kept
my
eye
on
every
day
waiting
for
the
moment
to
come
when
could
say
to
the
housekeeper
you
will
be
getting
me
in
some
more
butter
this
morning
would
you
get
salt
as
don't
much
like
the
other
wednesday
came
and
there
was
just
enough
left
for
two
days
would
speak
on
the
morrow
but
alas
on
the
morrow
there
was
another
new
pound
waiting
had
evidently
misjudged
the
amount
forget
what
happened
after
that
fancy
must
have
been
very
busy
so
that
the
question
of
butter
escaped
me
altogether
sometimes
too
would
go
away
for
few
days
and
the
old
butter
would
be
thrown
away
and
the
new
butter
bought
at
time
when
had
no
opportunity
of
defending
myself
however
it
was
there
came
time
when
had
been
three
months
in
my
rooms
and
was
still
eating
fresh
butter
contentedly
to
all
appearances
in
the
greatest
anguish
of
soul
as
it
happened
and
at
the
end
of
another
month
said
now
then
really
must
do
something
about
this
but
what
could
do
after
eating
fresh
butter
for
four
months
without
protest
couldn't
possibly
tell
the
housekeeper
that
didn't
like
it
and
would
she
get
salt
in
future
that
would
be
too
absurd
fancy
taking
four
months
to
discover
little
thing
like
that
nor
could
pretend
that
though
used
to
adore
fresh
butter
had
now
grown
tired
of
it
hate
instability
of
character
and
could
not
lend
myself
to
any
such
fickleness
put
it
to
you
that
either
of
these
courses
would
have
shown
deplorable
weakness
no
an
explanation
with
the
housekeeper
was
by
that
time
impossible
and
if
anything
was
to
be
done
must
do
it
on
my
own
responsibility
what
about
buying
pound
of
salt
butter
myself
and
feeding
on
it
in
secret
true
should
have
to
get
rid
of
certain
portion
of
fresh
every
day
but
don't
know
if
you
have
ever
tried
to
get
rid
of
certain
portion
of
fresh
butter
every
day
when
you
are
living
in
flat
at
the
very
top
of
chambers
in
london
drop
it
out
of
the
window
once
or
twice
and
it
is
an
accident
three
times
and
it
is
coincidence
four
times
and
the
policeman
on
duty
begins
to
think
that
there
is
more
in
it
if
may
say
so
than
meets
the
eye
but
what
about
the
fire
you
will
ask
ah
yes
but
could
foresee
day
when
there
would
be
no
fire
one
has
to
look
ahead
besides
as
said
hate
waste
as
any
cook
will
tell
you
the
whole
art
of
housekeeping
can
be
summed
up
in
three
words
watch
the
butter
more
months
passed
and
more
pats
of
vaseline
every
day
made
an
explanation
more
hopeless
had
thoughts
at
one
time
of
an
anonymous
letter
something
in
this
style
madam
one
who
is
your
friend
says
beware
of
vaseline
all
is
discovered
fly
before
it
is
too
late
what
is
it
makes
the
sea
so
salt
nacl
sodium
chloride
the
black
hand
that
would
give
her
the
impression
at
any
rate
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
butter
confound
it
all
by
what
right
did
she
assume
without
asking
that
had
preference
for
fresh
have
now
been
in
my
rooms
nearly
year
something
must
be
done
soon
my
breakfasts
are
becoming
farce
meals
which
used
to
enjoy
now
face
as
an
ordeal
is
there
to
be
no
hope
for
me
in
the
future
well
there
is
chance
shall
have
to
wait
until
july
but
with
something
definite
in
view
am
content
to
wait
in
july
hope
to
go
to
switzerland
for
month
two
days
before
returning
home
shall
write
to
my
housekeeper
having
announced
the
day
of
my
return
and
given
one
or
two
instructions
shall
refer
briefly
to
the
pleasant
holiday
which
have
been
enjoying
shall
remark
perhaps
on
the
grandeur
of
the
mountains
and
the
smiling
beauty
of
the
valleys
may
mention
the
area
in
square
miles
of
the
country
and
shall
dwell
upon
the
habits
of
the
native
they
live
shall
write
in
extraordinary
simplicity
chiefly
upon
the
products
of
their
farms
their
butter
is
the
most
delightful
have
ever
tried
it
is
little
salt
to
the
taste
but
after
four
weeks
of
it
begin
to
feel
that
shall
never
be
able
to
do
without
salt
butter
again
no
doubt
as
made
in
london
it
would
be
different
from
this
but
really
think
must
give
it
trial
so
when
you
are
ordering
the
things
mentioned
for
me
will
you
ask
for
salt
butter
and
if
that
fails
there
remains
only
the
one
consolation
in
three
years
my
lease
is
up
shall
take
new
flat
somewhere
and
on
the
very
first
day
shall
have
word
with
the
new
housekeeper
by
the
way
shall
say
about
the
butter
the
washing
of
course
it
is
quite
possible
to
marry
for
love
but
suspect
that
good
many
bachelors
marry
so
that
they
may
not
have
to
bother
about
the
washing
any
more
that
anyhow
will
be
one
of
the
reasons
with
me
offer
you
shall
say
my
hand
and
heart
and
the
washing
and
oh
do
see
that
six
tablecloths
and
my
footer
shorts
don't
get
sent
every
week
we
affect
hampstead
for
some
reason
every
week
number
of
shirts
and
things
goes
all
the
way
out
to
hampstead
and
back
once
sent
panama
to
paris
to
be
cleaned
and
for
quite
year
afterwards
used
to
lead
the
conversation
round
to
travel
and
then
come
out
with
ah
well
remember
when
my
panama
was
in
paris
so
now
when
am
asked
at
dance
do
you
know
hampstead
at
all
reply
well
only
know
it
slightly
myself
but
my
collars
spend
about
half
the
year
there
they
are
in
with
all
the
best
people
can
believe
that
am
not
popular
in
hampstead
for
give
my
laundress
lot
of
trouble
take
little
thing
like
handkerchiefs
my
rooms
as
have
mentioned
are
at
the
very
top
of
the
building
and
there
is
no
lift
usually
wait
till
am
just
out
into
the
street
before
discover
that
have
forgotten
my
handkerchief
it
is
quite
impossible
to
climb
all
the
stairs
again
so
go
and
buy
one
for
the
day
this
happens
about
three
times
week
the
result
is
that
nearly
all
my
handkerchiefs
are
single
ones
there
are
no
litters
of
twelve
no
twins
even
or
triplets
now
when
you
have
lot
of
strangers
in
drawer
like
this
with
no
family
ties
or
anything
to
keep
them
together
what
wonder
if
they
gradually
drift
away
from
each
other
my
laundress
does
her
best
for
them
she
works
sort
of
birthmark
in
red
cotton
in
the
corner
of
each
so
that
she
shall
know
them
again
when
saw
it
first
was
frightened
it
looked
like
the
password
of
some
secret
society
are
there
many
aliens
in
hampstead
asked
the
housekeeper
don't
know
sir
well
look
here
what
found
on
my
handkerchief
that's
secret
signal
of
some
sort
you
know
that's
what
it
is
shall
get
mixed
up
in
some
kind
of
anarchist
row
before
know
where
am
will
you
arrange
about
getting
my
clothes
washed
somewhere
else
please
that's
because
you
haven't
got
your
name
on
it
she
must
mark
them
somehow
then
why
doesn't
she
mark
them
with
my
name
so
much
simpler
it
isn't
her
business
to
mark
your
clothes
said
the
housekeeper
that
suppose
is
true
but
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
giving
us
both
lot
of
unnecessary
trouble
every
week
pick
out
this
decorative
design
with
penknife
and
every
week
she
works
it
in
again
when
you
consider
the
time
and
the
red
cotton
wasted
it
becomes
clear
that
sixpenny
bottle
of
marking
ink
and
quill
pen
would
be
cheaper
to
her
in
the
long
run
but
she
has
weakness
for
red
cotton
the
holes
in
the
handkerchiefs
she
works
round
with
it
never
quite
understand
why
to
call
my
attention
to
them
perhaps
and
to
prevent
me
from
falling
through
or
else
to
say
you
did
this
only
washed
up
to
the
red
so
it
can't
be
my
fault
if
were
married
and
had
house
of
my
own
there
would
be
no
man
below
consequently
he
wouldn't
wear
the
absurd
collars
he
does
get
about
two
of
them
week
so
even
red
cotton
is
not
infallible
and
if
they
were
the
right
size
and
decent
shape
shouldn't
grumble
so
much
but
do
object
to
my
collars
mixing
in
town
with
these
extraordinary
things
of
his
at
hampstead
it
may
be
they
have
to
meet
on
terms
of
equality
more
or
less
force
of
circumstances
throws
them
together
good
deal
but
in
town
no
collar
of
mine
could
be
expected
to
keep
up
the
acquaintance
you
knew
me
in
the
bath
can
imagine
one
of
his
monstrosities
saying
and
when
am
in
the
bath
shall
know
you
again
would
be
the
dignified
reply
of
my
golf
collars
trouble
me
good
deal
one
way
or
another
whenever
buy
new
dozen
all
the
others
seem
suddenly
to
have
become
old-fashioned
in
shape
and
of
the
wrong
size
nothing
will
induce
me
to
wear
one
of
them
again
they
get
put
away
in
boxes
covered
with
dust
they
lie
forgotten
forgotten
did
say
no
the
housekeeper
finds
them
and
sends
them
to
the
wash
about
month
later
she
finds
them
again
she
is
always
finding
clothes
which
have
been
discarded
for
ever
and
sending
them
to
the
wash
the
mistake
is
that
we
have
not
yet
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
what
really
is
to
go
to
the
wash
and
what
isn't
there
is
tacit
understanding
that
everything
on
the
floor
on
monday
morning
is
intended
for
hampstead
the
floor
is
the
linen-basket
it
seemed
good
idea
at
the
time
but
it
has
its
faults
things
gets
on
to
the
floor
somehow
which
were
never
meant
for
the
north-west
blankets
and
parts
of
tweed
suit
and
sofa
cushions
things
have
mysterious
way
of
dropping
half-a
dozen
pairs
of
white
flannel
trousers
dropped
from
shelf
one
december
pair
of
footer
shorts
used
to
go
every
week
pair
which
would
carefully
put
down
to
take
the
bath
water
when
had
finished
with
it
wonder
what
those
shorts
thought
they
were
doing
probably
they
quite
fancied
themselves
at
football
and
boasted
about
the
goals
they
shot
to
companions
whom
they
met
at
hampstead
you're
always
here
pair
of
local
wanderers
would
say
my
dear
man
play
so
hard
don't
care
how
dirty
get
the
irony
of
it
but
worst
of
all
the
laundry-book
every
week
the
housekeeper
says
to
me
would
you
pay
your
book
now
as
it's
been
owing
for
month
and
every
week
pay
that
sounds
absurd
but
swear
it's
true
or
else
the
weeks
go
very
quickly
and
such
amounts
great
ninepences
for
counterpane
or
tablecloth
or
white
tie
immense
numbers
of
handkerchiefs
counting
apparently
twelve
as
thirteen
quaint
hieroglyphics
which
don't
mean
anything
but
seem
to
get
added
into
the
price
and
always
that
little
postscript
as
this
has
been
owing
for
month
we
must
request
and
yet
they
want
to
put
tax
on
bachelors
taking
stock
beatrice
has
been
spring-cleaning
me
to-day
or
rather
my
clothes
said
wasn't
it
rather
early
for
it
as
none
of
the
birds
were
singing
properly
yet
and
she
had
much
better
wait
till
next
year
but
no
she
would
do
it
now
beatrice
is
my
sister-in
law
and
she
said
well
forget
what
she
did
say
but
she
took
whole
bundle
of
things
away
with
her
in
cab
and
know
john
will
be
wearing
that
purple
shirt
of
mine
to-morrow
as
matter
of
fact
it
was
perfectly
new
one
and
was
only
waiting
till
lent
was
over
beatrice
said
the
things
were
all
lying
about
anyhow
and
how
ever
found
anything
to
put
on
she
didn't
know
but
could
have
told
her
that
they
were
all
arranged
on
symmetrical
plan
of
my
own
beatrice
doesn't
understand
the
symmetry
of
bachelor's
mind
like
collar
in
each
drawer
and
then
whatever
drawer
you
open
there's
collar
ready
for
you
beatrice
puts
them
all
in
one
drawer
and
then
if
you're
in
hurry
and
open
the
wrong
drawer
by
mistake
you
probably
go
up
to
the
office
in
two
waistcoats
and
no
collar
at
all
that
would
be
very
awkward
beatrice
actually
wanted
braces
drawer
if
she
hadn't
married
john
should
never
let
her
talk
to
me
about
braces
but
explained
that
had
only
one
pair
and
was
wearing
those
so
that
it
would
be
absurd
expect
she
wanted
me
to
think
that
john
had
two
pairs
all
can
say
is
that
if
he
has
he
ought
to
be
above
taking
my
best
shirt
don't
think
the
waistcoat
drawer
will
be
success
there
are
twenty-three
of
them
and
some
of
them
don't
blend
at
all
well
twenty-three
in
one
drawer
you
know
there
are
bound
to
be
disputes
see
william
has
got
to
the
top
already
ah
he
was
fine
fellow
the
first
ever
had
don't
quite
know
how
to
describe
him
but
in
colour
he
was
emerald
green
with
bits
of
red
silk
peeping
through
sort
of
open-work
you
know
only
where
you
would
expect
to
see
me
there
was
more
of
william
wore
him
at
beatrice's
wedding
he
would
come
only
he
wouldn't
let
me
into
the
vestry
wanted
to
sign
my
name
all
the
others
were
have
never
worn
him
since
that
day
but
beatrice
has
fished
him
out
and
now
he
lies
on
the
very
top
of
the
drawer
of
course
it's
awfully
good
of
beatrice
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
my
clothes
and
i'm
extremely
grateful
and
after
all
she
did
marry
my
brother
john
but
think
sometimes
she
well
here's
case
you
know
when
you
have
twenty-three
waistcoats
you
perhaps
run
bit
short
of
of
other
things
so
naturally
the
few
you
have
got
left
you
well
beatrice
took
them
all
away
and
said
that
as
couldn't
possibly
wear
them
again
she'd
cut
them
up
for
house-cloths
and
really
half-way
between
winter
and
summer
is
very
awkward
time
for
restocking
but
suppose
it
is
going
to
be
warmer
now
house-cloths
bet
john
has
go
at
them
first
beatrice
found
what
they
call
in
the
profession
morning-coat
and
vest
under
the
bed
and
said
that
she
would
take
it
away
and
sell
it
for
me
like
the
way
she
finds
things
which
have
been
keeping
for
years
under
the
bed
it
is
absurd
to
talk
about
finding
anything
in
small
flat
because
of
course
it's
there
all
the
time
but
beatrice
thought
that
ought
to
be
grateful
to
her
for
the
discovery
so
pretended
was
she
said
she
would
get
at
least
half-a
crown
for
it
but
said
would
rather
have
the
coat
however
it
turned
out
that
wasn't
even
to
have
had
the
half-crown
used
to
have
thirty
pairs
of
old
white
gloves
in
drawer
would
take
them
out
sometimes
and
stroke
them
affectionately
and
say
ah
yes
those
were
the
ones
wore
at
that
absolutely
ripping
dance
when
first
met
cynthia
and
we
had
supper
together
you
can
see
where
spilt
the
ice
pudding
or
this
was
that
hunt
ball
when
knew
nobody
and
danced
with
hildegarde
all
the
time
she
wore
black
just
look
at
them
now
well
beatrice
had
that
drawer
out
pretty
quick
and
now
they
are
on
their
way
to
perth
or
paris
or
wherever
it
is
except
hildegarde's
pair
which
will
just
do
for
the
girl
when
she
cleans
the
grates
expect
she
really
will
get
them
you
know
because
john
doesn't
dance
you
know
you
mustn't
make
too
much
fun
of
beatrice
she
has
ripping
ideas
sometimes
she
filled
summer-trunk
for
me
trunk
full
of
all
the
clothes
am
going
to
want
in
the
summer
she
started
with
tennis-racquet
which
strictly
speaking
isn't
clothes
at
all
and
went
on
with
some
of
the
jolliest
light
waistcoats
you
ever
saw
it
made
me
quite
hot
to
look
at
them
well
now
that's
really
good
idea
so
far
as
it
goes
but
what
will
happen
when
the
summer
does
come
why
we
shall
have
to
go
through
the
whole
business
all
over
again
and
who'll
arrange
the
winter-trunk
beatrice
and
who'll
get
the
pink
pyjamas
and
the
green
socks
that
there's
really
no
room
for
dear
why
john
yet
am
sorry
for
john
he
was
once
as
am
what
life
is
his
now
beatrice
is
dear
and
will
allow
no
one
to
say
word
against
her
but
she
doesn't
understand
that
trousers
must
be
folded
not
hung
that
collar
which
has
once
been
collar
can
never
be
opened
out
and
turned
into
cuff
supposing
one
wore
cuffs
and
that
school
eleven
blazer
even
if
it
happens
to
be
pink
must
not
be
cut
down
into
dressing-jacket
for
the
little
one
poor
john
yes
am
glad
now
that
he
has
that
shirt
of
mine
it
is
perhaps
little
too
bright
for
his
complexion
perhaps
he
has
not
quite
the
air
to
carry
it
off
but
am
glad
that
it
is
his
now
think
of
it
have
tie
and
pair
of
socks
that
would
go
well
with
it
and
even
william
can
part
with
william
yes
he
shall
have
william
oh
see
that
must
be
kind
to
john
dear
beatrice
wonder
when
shall
have
everything
straight
again
medes
and
persians
have
already
said
that
am
not
afraid
of
my
housekeeper
so
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
say
it
again
there
are
other
motives
than
fear
which
prevent
man
from
arguing
with
housekeepers
dislike
of
conversation
with
his
intellectual
inferiors
may
be
one
the
sporting
instinct
is
certainly
another
if
one
is
to
play
medes
and
persians
properly
one
must
be
sportsman
about
it
of
course
could
say
right
out
to
her
do
this
and
she
might
do
it
or
she
could
say
right
out
to
me
do
that
and
would
reply
don't
be
absurd
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
game
as
play
it
mede
is
law
which
she
lays
down
and
to
which
after
many
struggle
in
the
end
submit
persian
is
law
which
lay
down
and
to
which
after
many
struggle
in
the
end
when
it
is
too
late
well
there
are
many
medes
but
so
far
have
only
scored
one
persian
of
note
the
first
mede
was
established
last
winter
for
many
weeks
had
opened
my
bedroom
door
of
morning
to
find
small
jug
of
cold
water
on
the
mat
outside
the
thing
puzzled
me
what
do
want
with
small
jug
of
cold
water
asked
myself
when
have
quite
enough
in
the
bath
as
it
is
various
happy
thoughts
occurred
to
me
as
that
it
was
lucky
that
it
collected
the
germs
or
who
knows
indicated
wife
with
five
thousand
year
but
it
was
month
before
the
real
solution
flashed
across
my
mind
perhaps
said
it
was
hot
once
but
added
it
must
have
been
long
time
ago
the
discovery
upset
me
good
deal
in
the
first
place
it
is
annoying
suddenly
to
have
all
one's
hopes
of
rich
wife
and
protection
from
disease
dashed
to
the
ground
in
the
second
object
to
anybody
but
relation
interfering
with
my
moral
character
here
was
comparative
stranger
trying
to
instil
the
habit
of
early
rising
into
me
by
leaving
shaving-water
outside
the
door
at
three
was
this
thing
to
be
taken
lying
down
decidedly
so
stayed
in
bed
and
ignored
the
water-jug
save
that
each
morning
as
left
my
rooms
gave
it
parting
sneer
it
was
gone
by
the
evening
but
turned
up
again
all
right
next
day
after
month
began
to
get
angry
my
housekeeper
was
defying
me
very
well
we
would
see
who
could
last
the
longer
but
after
two
months
it
was
mede
yet
have
this
triumph
over
her
that
though
take
the
water
in
pour
it
into
the
bath
and
slip
back
into
bed
again
don't
think
she
knows
that
since
then
there
have
been
many
medes
little
ones
as
to
the
position
of
the
chairs
bigger
ones
as
to
the
number
of
blankets
on
the
bed
you
mustn't
think
though
that
always
submit
so
easily
sometimes
am
firm
in
the
matter
of
africa
joe
have
been
very
firm
here
know
have
right
on
my
side
year
ago
was
presented
with
model
of
an
irish
jolting
car
with
horse
and
driver
complete
which
had
been
cut
out
of
some
sort
of
black
wood
the
thing
used
to
stand
over
my
fireplace
later
on
acquired
at
different
times
grey
hippopotamus
in
china
and
black
elephant
these
harnessed
on
in
front
of
the
horse
and
the
whole
affair
made
very
pretty
scene
which
was
known
to
my
friends
as
sunday
in
the
forest
africa
joe
drives
his
family
to
church
besides
all
these
had
yet
another
animal
green
frog
climbing
cardboard
ladder
leant
this
against
the
clock
one
had
the
illusion
that
the
frog
was
climbing
up
in
order
to
look
at
the
works
which
was
particularly
pleasing
because
the
clock
didn't
go
very
well
you
have
the
two
scenes
on
the
same
mantelboard
one
the
frog
as
bond
street
watchmaker
and
jeweller
and
the
other
such
is
empire
africa
joe
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
and
what
does
the
housekeeper
do
if
you
will
believe
me
she
takes
the
frog
down
from
the
clock
and
props
him
up
behind
the
car
just
as
though
he
were
getting
on
to
it
in
order
to
go
to
church
with
the
others
now
do
put
it
to
you
that
this
is
simply
spoiling
the
picture
altogether
here
we
have
pleasant
domestic
episode
such
as
must
occur
frequently
in
the
african
forests
black
joe
harnesses
his
horse
elephant
hippopotamus
or
what
not
and
drives
his
family
to
the
eleven
o'clock
service
and
into
this
scene
of
rural
simplicity
mere
housekeeper
elbows
her
way
with
irrevelant
frogs
and
ladders
it
is
mystery
to
me
that
she
cannot
see
how
absurd
her
contribution
is
to
begin
with
the
family
is
in
black
save
the
hippopotamus
who
is
in
quiet
grey
so
is
it
likely
that
they
would
tolerate
the
presence
of
garish
green-and
yellow
stranger
more
than
likely
joe
is
churchwarden
and
has
not
only
himself
to
think
of
then
again
consider
the
title
of
the
scene
africa
joe
drives
his
family
not
africa
joe
about
to
drive
the
horse
is
trotting
the
elephant
has
one
leg
uplifted
and
even
the
hippopotamus
is
not
in
position
of
rest
how
then
could
the
frog
put
ladder
up
against
moving
cart
and
climb
in
no
here
anyhow
was
mede
that
must
be
resisted
at
all
costs
on
the
question
of
africa
joe
would
not
be
dictated
to
but
after
re-emphasising
my
position
daily
for
three
weeks
saw
that
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
the
frog
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
idea
of
empire
so
burnt
him
but
it
is
time
mentioned
my
one
persian
it
was
this
way
in
the
winter
used
always
to
dry
myself
after
the
bath
in
front
of
my
sitting-room
fire
now
know
all
about
refraction
and
the
difficulty
of
seeing
into
room
from
outside
and
so
forth
but
this
particular
room
is
unusually
light
having
six
large
windows
along
one
of
its
sides
thought
it
proper
therefore
to
draw
down
the
three
end
blinds
by
the
fireplace
more
especially
as
the
building
directly
opposite
belonged
to
the
public
house
reform
association
in
the
fierce
light
that
beats
from
reform
associations
one
cannot
be
too
careful
little
things
like
blinds
easily
escape
the
memory
and
it
was
obvious
that
it
would
be
much
pleasanter
if
the
housekeeper
could
be
trained
always
to
leave
the
end
three
down
the
training
followed
its
usual
course
every
morning
found
the
blinds
up
and
every
morning
drew
them
down
and
left
them
there
after
month
it
seemed
impossible
that
could
ever
establish
my
persian
but
then
she
forgot
somehow
and
one
day
woke
up
to
find
the
three
blinds
down
by
real
stroke
of
genius
drew
them
up
as
soon
as
my
dressing
was
over
next
morning
they
were
down
again
bathed
dried
dressed
and
threw
them
up
she
thought
it
was
mede
and
pulled
them
down
but
it
was
persian
and
as
pulled
them
up
knew
that
had
scored
yet
after
all
am
not
so
sure
for
it
is
now
the
summer
and
have
no
fire
and
do
not
want
the
blinds
left
down
and
when
pull
them
up
every
morning
really
want
to
find
them
up
next
morning
but
find
them
down
so
perhaps
it
really
is
mede
to
tell
the
truth
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
not
so
clear
as
it
ought
to
be
must
try
to
come
to
some
arrangement
with
the
housekeeper
about
it
the
cupboard
it
was
the
landlord
who
first
called
my
attention
to
the
cupboard
should
never
have
noticed
it
myself
very
useful
cupboard
you
see
there
he
said
should
include
that
in
the
fixtures
indeed
said
not
at
all
surprised
for
the
idea
of
his
taking
away
the
cupboard
had
not
occurred
to
me
you
won't
find
many
rooms
in
london
with
cupboard
like
that
suppose
not
said
well
i'll
let
you
have
my
decision
in
few
days
the
rent
with
the
cupboard
you
say
is
and
named
the
price
yes
with
the
cupboard
so
that
settled
the
cupboard
question
settled
it
so
far
as
it
concerned
him
for
me
it
was
only
the
beginning
in
the
year
that
followed
my
eyes
were
opened
so
that
learned
at
last
to
put
the
right
value
on
cupboard
appreciate
now
the
power
of
the
mind
which
conceived
this
thing
the
nobility
of
the
great
heart
which
included
it
among
the
fixtures
and
am
not
ungrateful
you
may
tell
newly
married
man
by
the
way
he
talks
of
his
garden
the
pretence
is
that
he
grows
things
there
verbenas
and
hymantifilums
and
cinerarias
anything
which
sounds
but
of
course
one
knows
that
what
he
really
uses
it
for
is
to
bury
in
it
things
which
he
doesn't
want
some
day
shall
have
garden
of
my
own
in
which
to
conduct
funerals
with
the
best
of
them
until
that
day
content
myself
with
my
cupboard
it
is
marvellous
how
things
lie
about
and
accumulate
until
they
are
safely
in
the
cupboard
we
are
never
quite
at
ease
they
have
so
much
to
say
outside
and
they
put
themselves
just
where
you
want
to
step
and
sometimes
they
fall
on
you
yet
even
when
have
them
in
the
cupboard
am
not
without
moments
of
regret
for
later
on
have
to
open
it
to
introduce
companions
and
then
the
sight
of
some
old
friend
saddens
me
with
the
thought
of
what
might
have
been
oh
and
did
mean
to
hang
you
up
over
the
writing-desk
say
remorsefully
am
thinking
now
of
certain
picture
large
portrait
of
my
old
headmaster
it
lay
in
corner
for
months
waiting
to
be
framed
getting
more
dingy
and
dirty
every
day
for
the
first
few
weeks
said
to
myself
must
clean
that
before
send
it
to
the
shop
piece
of
bread
will
do
it
later
it's
extraordinary
how
clever
these
picture
people
are
you'd
think
it
was
hopeless
now
but
i've
no
doubt
when
take
it
round
to-morrow
month
after
that
somebody
trod
on
it
now
then
ask
you
what
could
do
with
it
but
put
it
in
the
cupboard
you
cannot
give
large
photograph
of
headmaster
bent
across
the
waistcoat
to
housekeeper
and
tell
her
that
you
have
finished
with
it
nor
would
dustman
make
it
his
business
to
collect
pedagogues
along
with
the
usual
cabbage
stalks
married
man
would
have
buried
it
under
the
begonia
but
having
no
garden
that
is
my
difficulty
for
bachelor
in
chambers
who
cannot
bury
there
should
be
some
other
consuming
element
than
fire
in
the
winter
might
possibly
have
burnt
it
is
small
quantities
monday
the
head
tuesday
the
watch-chain
but
in
the
summer
what
does
one
do
with
it
and
what
does
one
do
with
the
thousands
of
other
things
which
have
had
their
day
the
old
magazines
letters
papers
collars
chair
legs
broken
cups
you
may
say
that
with
the
co-operation
of
my
housekeeper
firmer
line
could
be
adopted
towards
some
of
them
perhaps
so
but
alas
she
is
willing
accessory
to
my
weakness
fancy
that
once
long
time
ago
she
must
have
thrown
away
priceless
ms
in
an
old
waistcoat
now
she
takes
no
risks
with
either
in
principle
it
is
virtue
in
practice
think
would
chance
it
it
is
big
cupboard
you
wouldn't
find
many
rooms
in
london
with
cupboard
like
that
and
it
is
included
in
the
fixtures
yet
in
the
ordinary
way
suppose
could
not
go
on
putting
things
in
for
ever
one
day
however
discovered
that
family
of
mice
had
heard
of
it
too
at
first
was
horrified
then
saw
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
they
might
help
me
to
get
rid
of
things
in
week
they
had
eaten
three
pages
of
nautical
almanac
interesting
pages
which
would
be
of
real
help
to
married
man
at
sea
who
wished
to
find
the
latitude
by
means
of
two
fixed
stars
but
which
to
bachelor
on
the
fourth
floor
were
valueless
the
housekeeper
missed
the
point
she
went
so
far
as
to
buy
me
an
extremely
patent
mousetrap
it
was
silly
trap
because
none
of
the
mice
knew
how
to
work
it
although
baited
it
once
with
cold
poached
egg
it
is
not
for
us
to
say
what
our
humbler
brethren
should
like
and
dislike
we
can
only
discover
by
trial
and
error
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
they
did
like
cold
poached
eggs
should
be
able
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
them
for
generally
had
one
over
of
morning
however
it
turned
out
that
they
preferred
vegetable
diet
almanacs
and
such
the
cupboard
is
nearly
full
don't
usually
open
it
to
visitors
but
perhaps
you
would
care
to
look
inside
for
moment
that
was
once
top-hat
what
do
you
do
with
your
old
top-hats
ah
yes
but
then
only
have
housekeeper
here
at
present
that
is
really
good
pair
of
boots
only
it's
too
small
all
that
paper
over
there
manuscript
well
you
see
it
might
be
valuable
one
day
broken
batting
glove
brown
paper
always
keep
brown
paper
it's
useful
if
you're
sending
off
parcel
daily
mail
war
map
paint-pot
doesn't
belong
to
me
really
but
it
was
left
behind
and
got
tired
of
kicking
it
over
old
letters
all
the
same
handwriting
bills
probably
ah
no
they
are
not
bills
you
mustn't
look
at
those
didn't
know
they
were
there
swear
didn't
thought
had
burnt
them
of
course
see
now
that
she
was
quite
right
yes
that
was
the
very
sweet
one
where
she
well
knew
even
then
that
mean
i'm
not
complaining
at
all
we
had
very
jolly
time
still
if
it
had
been
little
different
if
that
last
letter
well
might
by
now
have
had
garden
of
my
own
in
which
to
have
buried
all
this
rubbish
the
post
bag
the
other
day
received
letter
from
some
very
old
friends
of
mine
who
live
in
queen
victoria
street
memo
from
messrs
robinson
cigar
shippers
my
dear
sir
we
have
been
very
anxious
at
not
having
heard
from
you
for
nearly
year
we
trust
that
you
are
in
good
health
and
that
no
illness
or
bereavement
has
kept
you
from
writing
to
us
as
you
know
it
is
our
one
ambition
to
satisfy
you
in
the
matter
of
cigars
and
your
long
silence
on
the
subject
has
naturally
made
us
apprehensive
until
we
hear
from
you
however
we
shall
refuse
to
believe
that
the
last
lot
you
had
from
us
were
fatal
write
to
us
frankly
on
the
subject
how
did
you
like
the
cigars
we
sent
you
last
christmas
were
they
brown
enough
did
they
smoke
to
finish
strongly
one
third
shipper
who
went
to
havana
especially
to
select
this
lot
for
you
writes
us
that
in
this
respect
they
were
fit
for
an
ambassador
or
we
may
add
an
actor
manager
what
is
it
then
that
you
are
keeping
back
from
us
perhaps
you
could
not
light
them
if
this
was
the
case
you
should
have
written
to
us
before
and
we
would
either
have
sent
you
others
of
more
porous
quality
or
forwarded
you
our
special
gimlet
with
which
you
could
have
brought
about
the
necessary
draught
lay
bare
your
heart
to
us
about
these
cigars
do
you
mind
the
green
spots
connoisseur
like
yourself
will
of
course
understand
that
though
we
guarantee
that
all
the
cigars
sent
out
by
us
can
be
smoked
yet
the
quality
of
the
cigar
must
necessarily
vary
with
the
price
this
being
so
perhaps
you
would
care
to
try
slightly
higher-priced
cigar
this
time
we
have
referred
to
our
books
and
we
see
that
last
year
we
had
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
box
of
our
famous
flor
di
cabajo
at
the
hundred
nicer-coloured
cigar
is
the
blanco
capello
at
but
we
are
hoping
this
christmas
that
you
will
see
your
way
to
giving
our
celebrated
pompadoros
at
the
hundred
trial
they
have
all
the
features
of
the
cabajo
which
you
approved
together
with
breadth
and
charm
of
flavour
of
their
own
may
we
send
you
box
of
these
our
other
special
lines
are
the
am
coming
spirited
young
cigar
at
the
hundred
of
which
we
enclose
sample
the
ma
ana
prompt
and
impressive
the
hundred
note
this
cigar
has
band
the
there
and
back
good
persevering
cigar
only
never
comes
undone
however
we
are
quite
sure
that
none
of
these
will
appeal
to
such
fastidious
palate
as
yours
must
be
by
now
and
that
we
may
confidently
rely
on
your
order
for
box
of
pompadoros
we
may
say
that
if
you
should
unfortunately
have
completely
lost
your
taste
for
cigars
we
shall
be
happy
to
send
box
to
any
friend
of
yours
nothing
could
make
more
acceptable
present
and
nothing
would
endear
your
friend
or
his
relatives
to
you
so
completely
now
please
write
to
us
and
tell
us
what
you
feel
about
it
we
desire
to
make
friends
of
our
customers
we
do
not
wish
our
business
to
be
mere
commercial
undertaking
talk
to
us
as
freely
as
you
would
to
your
old
college
chum
or
fellow-clubman
we
insist
on
being
of
service
to
you
hoping
to
hear
from
you
within
day
or
two
we
are
etc
robinson
co
replied
at
once
memo
from
me
dear
old
friend
thousand
thanks
for
your
sympathetic
letter
and
the
book
with
the
pictures
upon
my
word
don't
know
which
of
the
cigars
like
best
they
all
look
so
jolly
are
they
photographs
or
water-colours
mean
are
they
really
as
brown
as
that
like
the
tall
well
set-up
one
on
page
see
you
say
that
it
smokes
strongly
to
finish
that
is
all
very
well
oswald
but
what
want
to
know
is
does
it
hang
the
beginning
at
all
some
of
these
cigars
with
strong
finish
are
very
slow
forward
you
know
many
thanks
for
the
sample
bless
you
rupert
didn't
mind
the
green
spots
what
do
they
mean
that
the
cigar
isn't
quite
ripe
yet
suppose
but
think
you
overdo
the
light
brown
spots
or
are
they
lucky
like
those
little
strangers
in
the
tea
yes
think
must
have
some
of
your
pompadoros
send
box
at
christmas
to
mr
smithson
of
cornhill
with
our
love
yours
and
mine
and
the
third
shipper's
i'll
pay
not
at
all
percy
it's
pleasure
he
sent
me
some
last
christmas
as
it
happened
left
em
in
the
train
before
had
smoked
one
but
that
wasn't
his
fault
was
it
i'll
get
some
for
myself
later
on
if
may
you
won't
mind
waiting
dear
old
soul
you
make
mistake
when
you
say
had
some
cigars
from
you
last
year
assure
you
i've
never
heard
of
your
name
till
to-day
that
was
why
didn't
write
on
your
birthday
you'll
forgive
me
won't
you
now
it
is
your
turn
to
write
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
your
children
and
the
third
shipper
and
the
light
brown
spots
and
everything
good-bye
your
very
loving
college
chum
the
correspondence
concluded
thus
dear
sir
we
have
received
your
esteemed
order
which
shall
be
promptly
executed
though
the
pompadoros
will
not
be
despatched
to
your
friend
till
christmas
they
are
now
being
selected
and
will
be
put
aside
to
cool
we
have
referred
again
to
our
books
and
find
that
box
of
our
celebrated
young
cabajos
was
indeed
despatched
to
your
address
last
year
on
the
advice
of
mr
smithson
of
cornhill
this
was
why
we
were
so
anxious
at
your
long
silence
we
are
etc
robinson
co
dear
old
sport
am
afraid
you
misunderstood
my
last
letter
the
pompadoros
are
for
myself
it
was
hundred
am
comings
which
wanted
for
my
friend
mr
smithson
must
tell
you
funny
thing
about
him
as
friend
of
both
of
us
you
will
be
interested
he
collects
cigar
bands
have
no
use
for
them
myself
so
if
it
isn't
troubling
you
would
you
send
the
pompadoro
bands
to
him
as
the
am
comings
haven't
any
of
their
own
you
might
put
them
on
the
cigars
to
save
packing
ever
your
devoted
fellow-clubman
going
out
alone
can
get
through
an
at
home
with
certain
amount
of
credit
no
doubt
make
mistakes
no
doubt
people
look
at
me
and
say
who
is
that
person
sitting
all
by
himself
in
the
corner
and
keeping
on
eating
muffins
but
at
any
rate
can
make
the
function
tolerable
one
when
however
flutter
in
under
the
wing
of
my
sister-in
law
with
my
hair
nicely
brushed
and
my
tie
pulled
straight
she
having
held
review
on
the
doorstep
then
it
is
another
matter
altogether
it
is
then
that
feel
how
necessary
it
is
to
say
the
right
thing
beatrice
has
pretty
ears
but
they
are
long-distance
ones
we
drifted
apart
immediately
but
was
sure
she
was
listening
found
myself
introduced
to
tall
athletic-looking
girl
there's
great
crowd
isn't
there
said
can
find
you
some
tea
or
anything
oh
please
she
said
with
smile
noted
the
smile
and
thanked
heaven
that
had
read
my
lady
grove
in
the
ordinary
way
say
to
strangers
will
you
take
dish
of
tea
with
me
but
just
in
time
lady
grove
had
warned
me
that
this
was
wrong
left
to
myself
hit
upon
the
word
find
can
find
you
some
tea
it
gives
the
idea
of
pursuit
and
the
or
anything
rounds
it
off
well
as
much
as
to
say
if
should
happen
to
come
back
with
sardine
on
toast
don't
blame
me
found
some
tea
after
long
struggle
but
by
that
time
had
lost
the
athlete
it
was
pity
because
was
going
to
have
talked
to
her
about
surrey's
victory
over
kent
at
ladies'
hockey
don't
know
anything
about
hockey
but
it's
obvious
that
surrey
must
play
kent
some
time
and
it
would
be
an
even
chance
that
surrey
would
win
the
good
conversationalist
takes
risks
cheerfully
well
the
international
having
disappeared
was
going
to
drink
the
tea
myself
when
caught
beatrice's
eye
on
me
will
you
have
some
tea
said
to
my
neighbour
think
little
coffee
thank
you
certainly
pressed
the
tea
into
the
hand
of
retired
colonel
and
hurried
off
now
that
shows
you
alone
should
have
quoted
the
lancet
on
coffee
microbes
and
insisted
on
her
having
my
cup
of
tea
this
would
have
led
us
easily
and
naturally
to
conversation
on
drinks
and
modern
journalism
we
should
have
become
friends
should
have
had
an
invitation
from
her
mother
to
lunch
and
should
have
smoked
two
of
her
father's
best
cigars
as
it
was
said
certainly
fetched
the
coffee
coughed
and
observed
that
there
was
rather
crowd
she
said
yes
and
turned
away
to
somebody
else
two
good
cigars
thrown
away
because
of
beatrice
was
slowly
recovering
from
my
loss
when
beatrice
herself
came
up
to
say
that
she
wanted
to
introduce
me
to
very
nice
girl
called
jane
something
in
the
ordinary
way
very
nice
girls
aren't
called
jane
anything
so
here
evidently
was
something
exceptional
buttoned
my
coat
boldly
and
followed
her
unbuttoning
it
nervously
on
the
way
here
he
is
she
said
and
left
us
this
is
what
they
call
introducing
how
do
you
do
started
i've
heard
such
lot
about
you
began
jane
brightly
never
know
what
to
say
to
that
there
must
be
right
answer
if
only
lady
grove
would
tell
us
as
it
was
said
thank
you
that
felt
wrong
so
added
so
have
about
you
explained
hurriedly
to
myself
said
you
know
you're
not
really
carrying
this
off
well
it's
idle
to
pretend
that
you
are
what
have
you
heard
wonder
beamed
jane
only
that
her
name
was
jane
something
ah
said
oh
you
must
tell
me
mean
i've
heard
friends
of
yours
mention
your
name
oh
she
said
disappointedly
thought
you
meant
but
of
course
everybody
has
heard
of
jane
h'r'r
of
miss
er
um
think
my
sister-in
law
yes
thank
you
we
have
train
to
catch
oh
must
you
really
go
er
good-bye
staggered
away
in
pursuit
of
beatrice
she
dragged
me
up
to
an
american
girl
as
judged
her
here
he
is
she
said
and
passed
on
so
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
the
american
there
is
no
answer
to
that
know
ignored
it
altogether
and
said
have
you
seen
the
budget
no
what's
that
oh
you
must
see
that
will
we'll
go
to-morrow
where
is
it
don't
think
americans
see
as
much
of
addison
road
as
they
ought
to
gave
the
usual
guide-book
directions
for
getting
there
and
was
just
beginning
to
be
interested
when
saw
beatrice's
inquiring
look
are
you
behaving
nicely
it
said
passed
on
hastily
was
very
lonely
for
while
after
that
three
times
got
plate
of
cucumber
sandwiches
safely
into
corner
and
three
times
sisterly
eye
dragged
us
out
again
after
the
third
failure
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
so
wandered
about
and
tried
to
decide
which
was
the
ugliest
hat
in
the
room
man
is
the
only
possible
judge
in
competition
of
that
sort
woman
lets
herself
be
prejudiced
by
such
facts
as
that
it
is
so
fashionable
or
that
she
saw
one
just
like
it
in
bond
street
my
dear
at
five
guineas
had
narrowed
the
competitors
down
to
five
two
of
which
were
on
form
certain
for
place
when
turned
round
and
saw
in
corner
behind
me
don't
know
if
you
will
believe
me
man
with
plate
of
cucumber
sandwiches
rubbed
my
eyes
in
amazement
man
at
an
at
home
sitting
down
and
eating
cucum
why
where
was
his
sister-in
law
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
the
favourite
in
my
competition
green
pink
hoops
was
disengaged
for
the
moment
went
up
to
the
man
took
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
away
from
his
corner
he
still
held
the
plate
in
his
hand
and
helped
myself
to
sandwich
must
introduce
you
whispered
in
his
ear
famous
prize-winner
we
pushed
our
way
up
to
the
lady
here
he
is
said
and
looked
round
triumphantly
for
beatrice
the
sidesman
for
the
third
day
running
for
what
seemed
weeks
but
was
the
last
two
days
i'd
pottered
up
and
down
that
blessed
baize
sorting
out
aunts
in
browns
and
aunts
in
greys
for
what
seemed
always
but
was
only
twice
looking
if
may
say
so
rather
nice
i'd
lent
hand
with
hymn-sheets
and
with
rice
once
more
the
dear
old
bells
ring
out
once
more
linger
pink
but
anxious
at
the
door
this
is
the
third
time
here
she
comes
oh
lor'
something
on
these
occasions
goes
and
thrills
my
fancy
waistcoat
at
the
first
will's
it
can't
be
hopeless
love
it
must
be
chills
something
sinking
feeling
round
the
heart
clutches
me
closely
from
the
very
start
and
tells
me
am
fairly
in
the
cart
something
and
yet
the
fiercest
unconcern
so
masks
me
that
the
vergers
never
learn
how
underneath
my
chest
yearn
and
yearn
wilt
thou
and
there
you
are
profoundly
stirred
gleam
of
hope
strikes
through
me
wild
absurd
no
luck
sigh
he's
on
it
like
bird
edward
john
and
lonely
at
the
back
wish
my
name
were
edward
could
hack
myself
that
was
never
christened
jack
amabel
amabel
take
thee
groan
and
give
profoundly
at
the
knee
there
but
for
someone
else
say
goes
me
fair
friends
mine
what
is
it
tries
to
shove
my
heart
into
my
watch-chain
as
above
it
can't
be
hopeless
chills
it
must
be
love
yet
not
for
amabel
no
weight
of
care
clogs
me
as
pursue
that
happy
pair
into
the
vestry
and
admire
them
there
save
this
take
the
clergyman
aside
tell
me
whisper
you're
the
third
i've
tried
do
or
do
not
embrace
the
bride
an
awkward
case
this
is
one
of
those
really
difficult
cases
being
the
seventh
of
the
quarter
where
the
editor
of
the
perfect
lady
simply
has
to
ask
his
readers
what
should
have
done
the
sort
of
reply
that
will
be
given
is
should
have
carried
it
off
easily
remarks
like
that
are
unhesitatingly
included
among
the
answers
adjudged
idiotic
the
thing
happened
in
the
train
while
was
returning
to
town
after
couple
of
nights
in
the
country
the
scene
an
empty
carriage
myself
in
one
corner
on
the
seat
opposite
lay
my
dressing-case
had
unlocked
it
in
order
to
take
out
book
and
was
deep
in
this
when
we
stopped
at
wayside
station
the
opening
of
the
door
woke
me
suddenly
somebody
was
daring
to
get
into
my
compartment
luckily
one
only
girl
women
always
wish
to
travel
with
their
backs
to
the
engine
in
the
event
of
an
accident
you
don't
have
so
far
to
go
she
sat
down
next
to
my
bag
naturally
jumped
up
full
of
politeness
seized
the
handle
and
swung
the
thing
up
on
to
the
rack
that
at
least
was
the
idea
it
was
carried
out
literally
but
not
figuratively
the
bag
went
up
beautifully
only
on
its
way
it
opened
and
the
contents
showered
down
upon
the
seats
the
floor
and
yes
even
upon
her
the
contents
this
story
shows
upon
what
small
accidents
great
events
turn
if
had
only
been
going
instead
of
coming
back
couple
of
clean
shirts
few
snow-white
collars
pair
of
sky-blue
pyjamas
perfectly
creased
socks
and
handkerchiefs
neatly
folded
one
would
not
have
minded
all
these
being
thrown
before
stranger
at
least
not
so
much
going
too
the
brushes
and
things
would
have
been
in
their
proper
compartments
they
would
have
swung
up
on
to
the
rack
feel
convinced
that
if
the
thing
had
happened
going
should
have
carried
it
off
all
right
we
should
have
laughed
together
we
should
have
told
each
other
of
similar
accidents
which
had
happened
to
friends
and
we
should
have
then
drifted
into
general
conversation
about
the
weather
going
but
coming
back
it
was
an
early
train
and
had
packed
hurriedly
the
brushes
and
things
had
been
put
in
anyhow
and
they
came
out
anyhow
there
was
an
absurd
piece
of
shaving
soap
wrapped
up
in
one
of
an
englishman's
letters
always
think
that
things
wrapped
up
like
that
look
so
horrible
there
was
shaving-brush
in
pink
piece
of
globe
lying
on
the
sky-blue
pyjamas
and
the
pyjamas
all
anyhow
then
the
collars
do
think
dirty
collar
besides
had
screwed
them
up
tightly
in
order
to
get
them
in
of
course
she
wouldn't
understand
that
socks
now
this
is
too
awful
don't
know
if
can
mention
this
well
well
then
they
had
two
wretched
sock-suspenders
attached
to
them
odd
ones
as
live
black
and
pink
you
see
had
got
up
in
hurry
and
handkerchiefs
they
had
been
shoved
into
the
pumps
had
been
pressed
for
space
and
you
know
there
were
about
thirty-nine
different
things
that
wanted
to
explain
to
her
in
novels
the
hero
is
always
throwing
upon
the
heroine
an
expressive
glance
full
of
meaning
that
is
what
wanted
there
is
probably
if
one
only
knew
it
shrug
wave
of
the
hand
which
really
does
express
the
fact
that
you
were
coming
and
not
going
and
took
in
the
times
yourself
and
had
packed
in
hurry
and
if
could
only
have
handed
statement
to
the
press
and
have
yet
to
mention
the
unkindest
blow
of
all
the
evening
clothes
themselves
the
only
presentable
things
stayed
in
the
bag
if
they
had
come
out
too
then
might
have
done
something
should
have
left
them
to
the
last
conspicuous
upon
the
floor
then
should
have
picked
them
up
slowly
examined
them
and
nodded
at
the
braid
on
the
trousers
as
if
to
say
hang
it
that's
the
sort
of
man
am
really
think
if
they
had
come
out
too
could
still
have
carried
the
thing
off
what
should
do
should
he
say
to
the
girl
close
your
eyes
and
count
twenty
and
see
what
somebody's
brought
you
and
then
while
she
was
not
looking
push
the
clothes
under
the
seat
should
he
be
quite
calm
and
stretching
in
front
of
her
say
my
sock
think
or
politely
perhaps
you
would
care
to
look
at
piece
of
the
daily
mail
should
he
disown
the
thing
altogether
i'm
very
sorry
let
me
put
them
back
for
you
that
would
have
been
master-stroke
or
should
he
to
divert
attention
pull
the
alarm
and
pay
his
five
pounds
like
man
but
what
did
do
alas
he
did
nothing
heroic
for
one
moment
he
stood
there
then
he
pulled
down
the
bag
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
throwing
the
things
in
madly
he
picked
up
the
bag
locked
it
and
put
it
on
the
rack
then
he
turned
to
the
girl
now
he
was
going
to
have
spoken
to
her
an
apology
laugh
yes
even
now
he
might
have
carried
it
off
only
he
happened
to
look
up
and
he
saw
above
her
head
the
cord
of
his
pyjamas
dangling
over
the
edge
of
the
rack
reverie
dear
amaryllis
may
call
you
that
seeing
do
not
know
your
proper
name
and
if
did
it
might
be
something
dull
like
madge
offer
you
my
broken
heart
knowing
that
if
you
do
not
want
the
thing
you
will
not
hesitate
to
mention
it
dear
amaryllis
will
you
please
be
mine
we
met
twas
at
dance
ten
days
ago
and
after
sundry
smiles
and
bows
from
me
and
other
rather
weary
smiles
from
you
and
certain
necessary
calculations
we
hit
at
last
upon
the
second
extra
and
made
an
assignation
for
the
same
shall
be
at
this
corner
here
you
said
and
right
or
words
to
that
effect
but
when
the
dance
came
round
we
both
were
tired
so
sat
it
out
instead
beneath
palm
which
probably
was
just
as
well
for
you
and
since
love
you
just
as
well
for
me
we
talked
but
what
about
can't
remember
save
this
that
you
were
rather
keen
on
golf
that
had
never
been
to
scarborough
and
both
of
us
thought
well
of
bernard
shaw
we
talked
but
all
the
time
looked
at
you
and
wondered
much
what
inspiration
led
your
nose
to
tilt
at
just
that
perfect
angle
and
wondered
how
on
earth
you
did
your
hair
and
why
your
eyes
were
blue
when
it
was
black
and
why
hundred
other
different
things
until
at
last
another
dance
beginning
you
left
me
lonely
whereupon
went
back
to
the
supper-room
and
filled
glass
and
drank
and
lit
cigarette
and
sighed
and
asked
the
waiter
had
he
been
in
love
and
told
the
waiter
yes
am
in
love
and
gave
him
twopence
and
went
home
to
bed
am
in
love
well
no
hardly
think
so
for
one
i'm
much
too
happy
as
am
for
two
shall
forget
you
by
to-morrow
for
three
do
not
care
about
your
friends
the
men
you
danced
with
bounders
all
of
them
for
four
and
five
and
six
and
all
the
rest
i'm
fairly
sure
we
shall
not
meet
again
not
that
mind
no
as
said
before
i'm
very
much
too
happy
as
am
besides
shall
forget
you
by
to-morrow
then
why
this
letter
well
two
incidents
have
led
me
to
it
here
you
have
them
both
first
then
that
sitting
in
my
rooms
last
week
sitting
and
smoking
thinking
not
of
you
not
altogether
but
of
many
things
politics
football
dinner
and
tobacco
quite
suddenly
this
thought
occurred
to
me
by
jove
wish
had
little
dog
terrier
an
irish
terrier
wonder
if
the
landlord
would
object
and
thinking
thus
rose
and
sighed
and
bent
to
take
my
boots
off
had
mouse
appeared
could
have
loved
it
in
my
loneliness
had
but
the
humblest
cockroach
shown
his
head
think
would
have
said
good-night
to
it
this
too
give
it
you
for
what
it's
worth
next
morning
passing
through
st
james's
park
morning
for
the
gods
all
blue
and
white
heard
what
strictly
should
have
been
skylark
but
probably
was
quite
common
bird
offering
up
its
very
soul
to
heaven
then
suddenly
stopped
and
cried
oh
lord
oh
lord
cried
wish
it
were
the
spring
so
there
you
have
it
now
it's
off
my
chest
just
for
one
moment
you
upset
me
slightly
disturbed
my
usual
calm
serenity
got
in
my
head
and
set
me
vainly
wishing
for
april
and
the
country
and
one
other
but
that
is
over
am
whole
again
good-bye
shall
not
send
this
letter
now
find
have
forgotten
you
already
retrospect
looking
back
on
the
past
year
can
see
that
it
has
been
as
usual
one
of
noble
endeavour
frequently
frustrated
but
invariably
well
meant
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
newspapers
have
set
down
here
its
record
of
achievement
in
the
different
provinces
of
art
bicycling
and
the
like
and
offer
this
to
the
public
in
full
confidence
of
its
sympathy
and
appreciation
art
we
have
had
our
photographs
taken
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
and
if
the
result
isn't
art
don't
know
what
is
the
photographer
said
would
you
like
them
en
silhouette
or
straight-fronted
we
said
in
french
that
we
had
thought
of
carte-de
visite
the
result
is
sort
of
three-quarter
face
with
one
wing
forward
and
the
man
insists
that
we
must
have
looked
like
that
once
the
only
other
achievement
in
the
world
of
art
is
moleskin
waistcoat
of
some
distinction
had
no
idea
that
moles
were
that
colour
but
the
man
swore
that
when
you
had
taken
the
feathers
out
of
them
you
found
quite
different
coloured
skin
underneath
as
he
has
been
there
and
haven't
cannot
argue
with
him
altogether
good
year
for
art
bicycling
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
our
eldest
brother
sold
our
bicycle
for
sovereign
and
gave
the
sovereign
to
our
second
brother
bad
year
for
bicycling
therefore
science
thought
for
the
moment
science
began
with
which
is
why
it
comes
in
here
several
important
discoveries
have
been
made
in
the
year
for
instance
the
small
white
raspberries
in
tapioca
pudding
are
meant
to
be
there
you
always
thought
that
they
had
got
in
from
some
other
dish
when
the
cook
wasn't
looking
and
when
your
watch
gains
foot
you
don't
put
the
regulator
to
because
it
is
advancing
but
to
because
you
want
to
retard
it
or
else
the
other
way
round
have
forgotten
again
anyhow
found
out
that
had
been
doing
it
wrong
another
discovery
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
was
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
bank
rate
unchanged
but
that
is
too
technical
to
explain
here
record
year
for
science
finance
the
old
system
of
keeping
no
accounts
and
never
filling
in
the
counterfoils
of
cheques
again
answered
admirably
games
the
past
year
marks
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
games
we
have
retired
from
football
and
are
not
the
cricketer
we
were
but
on
the
other
hand
we
have
made
immense
strides
in
croquet
we
improve
slowly
at
billiards
in
november
we
potted
the
red
rather
neatly
and
everybody
said
there's
no
getting
away
from
that
he
must
have
meant
it
as
matter
of
fact
but
it
would
spoil
it
to
explain
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
we
could
have
shown
you
trick
or
two
at
tennis
that
is
all
except
that
can
no
longer
jump
the
ancestral
herbaceous
border
as
the
gardener
keeps
on
discovering
hydrostatics
archimedes'
principle
that
if
heavy
body
gets
into
cold
bath
quickly
an
equal
amount
of
water
gets
out
on
to
the
mat
quickly
was
demonstrated
daily
to
the
complete
dissatisfaction
of
the
man
on
the
floor
below
who
however
made
still
more
important
discovery
in
this
interesting
branch
of
dynamics
viz
that
water
does
not
find
its
own
level
but
prefers
something
about
ten
feet
lower
down
indigo
indigo
has
maintained
its
status
quo
throughout
the
year
there
have
been
occasions
during
this
time
when
we
had
almost
decided
to
be
an
indigo
planter
in
assam
rather
than
stick
it
in
this
beastly
country
on
each
occasion
the
weather
cleared
just
before
we
had
packed
the
sandwiches
music
space
and
time
alike
fail
us
to
tell
of
our
notable
triumphs
upon
the
pianola
in
the
year
that
has
just
elapsed
we
have
played
the
sonata
appassionata
and
shuffling
jasper
with
equal
verve
and
chiaroscuro
the
fruitness
and
nutty
flavour
of
our
rendering
of
remorse
valse
tzigane
no
kindly
return
by
the
end
of
the
month
will
never
be
forgotten
in
july
one
of
the
black
notes
stuck
down
and
refused
to
budge
for
some
time
but
we
got
it
up
at
last
with
potted-meat
opener
say
don't
think
much
of
liszt
he
has
pace
and
staying
power
and
is
good
strider
quite
useful
man
over
timber
he
might
be
but
he
is
little
lacking
in
what
shall
say
adagio
con
molto
expressione
ma
non
troppo
if
you
know
what
mean
pets
walter
the
white
mouse
perished
in
may
the
doctor
said
it
was
too
much
exercise
on
an
empty
well
he
put
it
rather
crudely
you
know
what
doctors
are
and
you
know
how
white
mice
will
exercise
the
tailor
said
walter
was
too
small
to
make
up
into
white
waistcoat
even
an
evening
one
and
that
he
would
be
hopeless
as
tie
advertised
for
white
mole
but
they
seem
to
be
rare
altogether
it
was
sad
year
for
pets
thought
perhaps
the
past
year
was
above
all
year
for
thought
to
the
pursuit
of
thought
we
devoted
many
days
in
many
positions
some
people
would
find
it
impossible
to
think
properly
immediately
after
breakfast
but
we
proved
that
given
sufficiently
comfortable
chair
the
impossible
could
be
achieved
that
one
could
be
as
thoughtfully
busy
in
the
morning
as
in
the
afternoon
xylonite
we
did
not
do
any
of
this
yclept
we
were
yclept
every
morning
punctually
at
eight
and
arose
punctually
at
nine
thirty
throughout
the
year
zeugma
suppose
you
thought
couldn't
do
well
this
is
just
to
show
you
in
the
ordinary
way
of
course
should
have
referred
to
the
zeugma
under
music
we
ordered
low-strung
one
last
month
but
it
has
not
yet
been
delivered
so
much
for
my
record
of
the
past
year
reading
it
over
now
feel
that
have
not
spent
the
last
twelve
months
in
vain
at
the
end
of
them
can
say
truthfully
that
am
if
not
year
wiser
at
least
year
older
year
fatter
and
still
happy
bachelor
letters
to
charles
dear
charles
can
you
lend
me
penny
have
just
been
making
up
my
accounts
for
the
day
the
idea
occurred
to
me
suddenly
it's
thing
have
never
done
before
and
am
seven
shillings
and
penny
out
the
seven
shillings
don't
mind
but
the
penny
worries
me
dreadfully
think
that
if
you
lent
me
another
one
should
gradually
be
able
to
settle
down
again
lie
when
say
have
never
made
up
accounts
before
did
it
on
one
memorable
occasion
years
and
years
ago
when
john
and
were
at
school
we
had
certain
expenses
such
as
subscriptions
to
the
mission
and
to
various
house
competitions
train
fares
masters'
wedding
presents
haircutting
and
so
on
which
did
not
come
out
of
our
pocket
money
or
tips
but
which
were
specially
sent
to
us
from
home
to
save
the
trouble
of
this
we
were
given
at
the
beginning
of
one
term
five
pounds
to
see
us
through
all
these
expenses
with
the
understanding
that
we
were
to
account
for
it
afterwards
afterwards
meant
the
holidays
which
to
begin
with
were
long
way
off
as
they
came
nearer
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
the
required
account
was
mere
formality
which
would
probably
not
be
insisted
upon
the
actual
money
had
been
spent
which
after
all
was
the
main
thing
the
idea
of
the
whole
proceeding
so
to
say
to
wish
to
linger
over
the
details
of
its
gradual
dissolution
would
be
morbid
however
to
our
horror
day
did
come
in
the
holidays
when
we
were
peremptorily
ordered
to
provide
our
account
and
to
hand
over
the
balance
there
is
as
you
know
charles
never
any
difficulty
about
providing
an
account
the
trouble
is
to
hand
over
the
balance
in
our
case
the
balance
was
exactly
nothing
we
had
not
penny
in
our
pockets
the
money
had
been
spent
all
right
an
unusual
number
of
masters
having
been
married
that
term
some
of
them
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
in
the
year
but
we
could
not
possibly
make
up
our
accounts
so
that
to
farthing
the
two
sides
balanced
it
would
look
so
unnatural
how
could
we
march
solemnly
into
the
library
and
say
by
perfectly
amazing
coincidence
the
money
you
gave
us
was
just
precisely
the
amount
which
the
circumstances
demanded
there
is
no
balance
it
was
very
hot
afternoon
and
we
were
unhappy
the
matter
of
the
accounts
was
not
the
only
shadow
which
hung
over
us
john
had
fox
terrier
so
had
but
whereas
my
dog
was
little
englander
and
stayed
at
home
john's
was
an
imperialist
who
roamed
the
country
he
had
disappeared
again
the
night
before
and
had
been
observed
in
the
morning
in
village
three
miles
away
thither
toiled
john
in
search
of
him
that
hot
afternoon
his
heart
torn
between
his
love
for
his
dog
and
his
duty
to
his
parents
and
rags
and
remained
at
home
to
see
what
we
could
make
of
finance
we
made
but
little
of
it
the
more
thought
of
it
the
more
impossible
it
seemed
to
say
that
every
penny
no
more
no
less
of
the
five
pounds
had
been
spent
properly
one
idea
had
which
touched
genius
namely
to
furnish
an
account
for
five
pounds
ten
say
and
point
out
that
the
balance
was
owing
to
us
ours
was
always
great
family
for
ideas
but
you
see
the
weak
spot
charles
that
we
hadn't
demanded
the
ten
shillings
long
ago
and
then
john
returned
no
he
had
not
found
his
dog
but
he
had
found
shilling
in
the
road
he
had
spent
he
simply
had
to
spend
he
said
penny
ha'penny
on
refreshment
but
the
tenpence
ha'penny
he
had
brought
back
joyfully
and
in
the
evening
beautiful
account
on
the
double-entry
system
and
tenpence
ha'penny
balance
were
handed
over
with
ceremony
so
much
for
finance
charles
now
i've
got
some
news
for
you
i've
just
had
nephew
uncle
doing
well
did
you
know
look
here
we'll
arrange
sporting
match
between
him
and
your
son
over
hurdles
for
your
boy
will
still
be
year
older
but
bless
you
don't
mind
that
my
nephew
is
so
ugly
at
present
that
feel
he
must
be
intended
for
the
highest
honours
at
something
probably
hurdles
of
course
if
either
of
us
perishes
in
the
meantime
the
nominations
become
void
the
nominations
become
void
did
you
notice
that
quite
the
sportsman
what
sort
of
weather
are
you
having
ask
because
the
weather
differs
according
to
the
locality
and
down
at
castle
bumpbrook
it
may
be
quite
fine
while
it
is
raining
here
and
vice
versa
why
is
this
why
shouldn't
the
weather
be
the
same
everywhere
something
to
do
with
the
solstices
believe
what
is
solstice
have
asked
you
no
end
of
questions
in
this
letter
and
don't
suppose
you
will
answer
one
of
them
do
you
grow
oranges
at
castle
forgive
the
familiarity
exhausted
by
my
divings
into
the
remote
and
wicked
past
have
just
eaten
about
six
get
through
quite
dozen
day
the
fact
is
heard
doctor
say
the
other
night
that
they
were
extremely
good
for
the
complexion
or
else
extremely
bad
couldn't
quite
catch
which
he
spoke
very
indistinctly
it
was
pity
that
missed
what
seems
to
have
been
the
important
word
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
so
much
about
the
extremely
however
go
on
eating
them
and
if
one
day
you
turn
up
in
town
and
find
me
full-blown
mulatto
you
will
know
that
the
word
was
bad
shall
become
sort
of
test
case
like
wreford
partington
eminent
people
will
refer
to
me
how
nice
to
be
referred
to
not
that
it
would
be
the
first
time
refer
to
drawer
remember
on
my
cheques
at
cambridge
that
sir
was
me
do
you
know
made
up
the
names
wreford
and
partington
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
names
are
simple
enough
but
think
the
combination
is
wonderful
there
must
have
been
such
case
in
who
do
you
think
wreford
was
fancy
he
was
small
chandler
and
he
fell
down
the
coal
shoot
of
partington's
in
cannon
street
james
partington
the
senior
partner
said
fairly
enough
that
great
firm
like
his
which
had
branches
all
over
england
including
norwich
must
have
coal
some
time
if
they
were
to
cope
successfully
with
increasing
foreign
competition
which
owing
to
the
present
gov
oh
no
this
was
forgot
well
anyhow
he
said
they
must
have
coal
wreford
retorted
that
he
didn't
mind
their
putting
coal
down
their
shoot
but
when
it
came
to
including
respectable
citizens
of
london
you
remember
the
excitement
when
the
case
came
on
we
were
only
babies
then
but
have
recollection
that
my
nurse
was
pro-partington
wreford
won
but
as
he
was
heavily
fined
for
having
knowingly
caused
crowd
to
collect
it
did
him
little
good
poor
man
good-bye
write
to
me
soon
and
tell
me
all
about
castle
bumpbrook
what
glorious
name
often
say
it
to
myself
it
is
the
only
strong
language
ever
use
now
ii
dear
charles
many
thanks
for
your
definition
of
solstice
is
it
really
fancy
by
answering
one
of
my
questions
you
become
unique
correspondent
nobody
else
answers
questions
in
letter
sometimes
of
course
one
is
asked
what
train
are
you
coming
down
by
on
saturday
let
me
know
at
once
but
the
proper
thing
to
do
in
such
case
is
to
wait
till
saturday
afternoon
and
then
wire
just
missed
the
two
twenty-two
hope
to
catch
the
next
questions
in
letters
are
mostly
rhetorical
which
is
why
ask
you
how
oh
how
could
you
have
the
nerve
to
head
your
paper
castle
bumpbrook
and
fill
it
with
arguments
against
the
budget
it
is
hardly
decent
you
know
doubt
if
you
ought
even
to
have
heard
of
the
budget
at
castle
bumpbrook
what
expect
from
you
is
pleasant
gossip
about
the
miller's
daughter
is
she
engaged
yet
to
the
postman
has
the
choir
begun
to
practise
the
christmas
anthem
when
does
mrs
bates'
husband
come
out
these
are
the
things
you
should
tell
me
tell
me
too
of
your
simple
recreations
has
whist
reached
castle
bumpbrook
yet
it
is
jolly
game
for
four
one
person
deals
and
you
turn
up
the
last
card
and
then
the
but
must
send
you
book
about
it
have
been
having
correspondence
with
my
landlord
as
to
what
should
do
in
case
of
fire
of
course
if
your
little
cottage
got
alight
you
would
simply
hop
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
geranium
bed
but
it
is
different
in
london
particularly
when
you
are
on
the
top
floor
well
he
tells
me
that
can
easily
get
out
on
to
mr
podby's
roof
next
door
and
so
home
this
is
certainly
comforting
but
podby
don't
like
it
charles
supposing
anything
happened
just
think
how
it
would
look
in
the
papers
the
unfortunate
gentleman
was
last
seen
upon
mr
podby's
roof
no
shall
have
to
go
for
the
drain-pipe
at
the
back
look
here
have
two
stories
to
tell
you
one
is
quite
true
the
other
isn't
which
will
you
have
first
all
right
the
truth
when
first
came
to
town
was
very
mean
believed
everything
was
told
one
sunday
met
small
but
elderly
gentleman
on
the
embankment
who
asked
me
the
way
to
the
german
embassy
he
had
the
river
to
his
south
so
obviously
all
the
embassies
were
in
the
other
direction
pointed
vaguely
towards
the
north
he
thanked
me
and
said
that
by
the
way
do
you
prefer
oratio
recta
forgot
to
ask
you
well
then
he
said
the
embassies
would
be
shut
on
sunday
hein
said
doubtless
he
said
am
professor
at
heidelberg
have
just
arrived
in
london
and
have
no
money
to-morrow
go
to
my
embassy
and
get
some
meanwhile
could
you
lend
me
five
shillings
charles
in
those
days
was
very
well
gave
him
half-a
crown
he
said
should
like
to
pay
this
back
to
you
said
quite
so
that
is
the
idea
then
would
you
give
me
your
card
so
that
can
send
you
the
money
to-morrow
charles
you
see
had
just
had
some
cards
printed
they
had
mr
on
for
the
first
time
was
very
well
gave
him
one
that
ends
the
first
scene
an
interval
of
nearly
five
years
elapses
and
we
come
to
last
saturday
was
walking
through
the
green
park
when
small
but
elderly
gentleman
came
up
to
me
he
said
is
this
the
way
to
the
school
of
music
said
which
one
do
you
want
there
is
the
guildhall
school
and
the
royal
college
and
the
royal
academy
and
he
thought
for
moment
and
then
he
said
in
german
the
german
for
do
you
speak
german
my
dear
charles
can't
spell
it
said
nein
he
considered
little
and
said
parlez-vous
fran
ais
said
what's
the
french
for
not
very
well
well
that's
what
said
at
this
his
face
brightened
he
drew
long
breath
and
began
am
professor
of
music
at
heidelberg
charles
had
to
interrupt
him
simply
couldn't
help
it
said
then
you
owe
me
half-a
crown
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
sort
of
sad
dignity
then
he
turned
round
with
sigh
and
plodded
wearily
across
the
park
and
oh
do
hope
he
had
better
luck
with
somebody
else
because
he
has
been
at
it
for
five
years
now
and
it
must
be
heart-breaking
life
his
hair
had
gone
quite
grey
since
saw
him
last
charles
you
do
see
that
that
is
true
story
don't
you
if
had
been
making
it
up
should
have
said
that
he
gave
me
back
my
own
card
as
reference
wonder
why
he
didn't
suppose
it
had
got
rather
dirty
after
five
years
do
you
want
the
other
one
now
it
is
the
merest
anecdote
and
hilda
told
it
me
and
know
it's
not
true
she
has
cat
called
didums
poor
little
kitty
wee
then
you
put
the
accent
on
the
then
and
spread
it
out
as
long
as
you
can
well
didums
etc
goes
about
eating
moths
curious
diet
for
cat
but
believe
it
keeps
them
thin
he
swallowed
them
whole
you
know
and
hilda
told
him
how
cruel
it
was
she
seems
to
have
spoken
of
the
sufferings
of
the
imprisoned
ones
in
the
most
moving
terms
anyhow
she
found
didums
next
day
up
in
her
bedroom
remorsefully
eating
sealskin
coat
am
surprised
at
hilda
if
she
is
not
careful
her
baby
will
grow
up
journalist
have
seen
him
since
he
came
back
from
you
this
time
approached
from
the
west
and
noticed
great
difference
he
is
certainly
fine
child
and
as
he
let
me
put
him
to
sleep
love
him
after
all
looks
don't
matter
tuppence
to
man
the
great
thing
is
wisdom
knowledge
comes
but
wisdom
lingers
remember
general
knowledge
paper
in
my
mays
one
of
the
questions
was
give
list
of
the
chief
coaling-stations
you
would
pass
on
your
way
to
new
zealand
the
only
two
could
think
of
were
cyprus
and
rickett
smith
never
heard
whether
got
full
marks
probably
not
but
since
that
day
knowledge
has
come
for
have
friend
in
the
admiralty
he
was
very
high
wrangler
the
year
wasn't
and
just
as
fisher
is
the
man
behind
the
first
lord
so
he
is
the
man
behind
fisher
at
least
he
tells
me
so
and
he
buys
his
tobacco
by
the
knot
or
is
it
the
quid
and
plays
the
hague
convention
at
bridge
and
as
say
knows
all
the
coaling-stations
from
cambridge
to
new
zealand
wisdom
lingers
what
splendid
title
for
novel
you
would
expect
fine
moral
tale
and
it
would
turn
out
to
be
the
story
of
the
lingers
family
wisdom
lingers
there
you
have
the
essence
of
successful
book-naming
hand
the
idea
to
you
charles
in
the
certainty
that
you
would
steal
it
anyhow
do
you
know
anything
about
gas
buy
lot
every
week
for
my
geyser
you
get
about
for
half-a
crown
thousand
what
don't
know
but
like
to
take
part
in
these
great
business
transactions
and
am
now
writing
to
ask
if
they
could
make
it
seeing
that
am
regular
customer
no
harm
in
asking
iii
dear
charles
do
you
truly
want
me
to
recommend
you
something
to
read
well
why
not
try
the
serial
story
in
some
ha'penny
paper
there
you
get
glimpse
of
the
real
thing
turned
idly
to
lepers
in
israel
or
whatever
it
is
called
last
night
and
found
myself
suddenly
up
to
the
neck
in
tragedy
lord
billingham
charles
you're
married
man
tell
me
if
it
really
is
so
the
gentle
pamela
is
urged
by
cruel
mother
to
espouse
lord
billingham
for
his
money's
sake
lord
is
vulgar
brute
i'm
afraid
in
any
case
pamela
is
all
for
young
prendergast
but
one
must
be
sensible
you
know
and
money
does
make
difference
doesn't
it
so
she
becomes
lady
billingham
and
year
or
two
later
prendergast
comes
back
from
south
africa
to
find
that
it
is
he
who
is
the
real
lord
billingham
after
all
got
most
of
this
from
the
synopsis
which
enables
you
to
start
the
story
now
so
can't
say
how
it
was
they
overlooked
him
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
extremely
cruel
you
see
that
charles
to
talk
about
it
because
pamela
would
then
become
plain
mrs
stubbs
and
no
money
at
all
so
prendergast
decides
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
but
he
was
reckoning
without
mrs
trevelyan
no
less
mrs
trevelyan
finds
out
the
secret
and
threatens
prendergast
that
she
will
tell
everybody
that
he
is
the
real
lord
billingham
unless
he
marries
her
so
of
course
he
has
to
it
is
at
this
moment
that
we
meet
captain
pontifax
captain
pontifax
is
in
love
with
mrs
trevelyan
at
least
he
thinks
he
is
and
he
says
that
if
she
doesn't
marry
him
he
will
let
on
about
what
happened
to
mr
trevelyan
who
was
supposed
to
have
died
of
old
age
at
the
same
time
the
news
gets
out
that
prendergast
is
really
lord
billingham
and
so
pamela
does
become
mrs
stubbs
and
as
prendergast
cannot
honourably
withdraw
from
the
alliance
he
is
about
to
contract
with
mrs
trevelyan
it
looks
as
though
she
is
going
to
be
lady
billingham
but
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
body
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
old
chalk
quarry
whose
what
want
to
hear
from
you
charles
is
do
people
always
get
married
for
this
sort
of
reason
are
you
really
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
did
kitty
discover
your
secret
and
threaten
to
disclose
it
oh
you
coward
don't
mind
anybody
knowing
that
am
the
true
earl
billingham
about
the
body
we
shall
know
to-morrow
think
it's
captain
pontifax
myself
but
will
send
you
telegram
are
you
an
authority
on
dress
man
got
into
my
carriage
on
the
district
to-day
wearing
top-hat
frock-coat
and
brown
boots
is
that
right
ask
it
seriously
because
the
point
want
to
discover
is
this
supposing
you
suddenly
found
that
you
had
nothing
in
the
house
but
brown
boots
and
frock-coat
would
bowler
or
topper
be
the
better
way
out
of
it
you
see
the
idea
charles
if
you
add
bowler
then
the
thing
you
have
to
explain
away
is
the
coat
don't
quite
see
how
that
is
to
be
managed
you
could
only
put
it
down
to
absent-mindedness
but
if
you
add
topper
then
you
have
only
the
brown
boots
to
account
for
this
could
be
done
in
variety
of
ways
foggy
morning
sudden
attack
of
colour-blindness
or
that
your
mother
asked
you
to
wear
the
thickest
ones
dear
and
never
mind
about
the
silly
fashion
it
is
an
interesting
point
which
has
never
been
dealt
with
properly
in
the
etiquette-books
you
and
are
agreed
upon
the
topper
it
seems
went
to
play
last
tuesday
it
was
not
bad
but
the
funniest
scene
happened
right
at
the
beginning
when
watched
an
american
buy
seat
at
the
box-office
they
gave
him
and
he
only
discovered
it
after
he
had
paid
for
it
and
had
put
his
change
carefully
away
do
you
know
charles
he
nearly
cried
the
manager
assured
him
there
was
nothing
in
it
people
sat
there
every
night
and
were
heard
of
again
it
was
no
good
he
got
his
money
back
and
went
away
looking
quite
miserable
isn't
it
childish
am
going
to
be
married
on
friday
th
may
just
to
show
when
is
that
sickening
if
it's
not
for
years
and
years
have
patent
calendar
somewhere
which
tells
you
the
date
for
any
year
up
to
never
know
why
it
should
stop
there
something
to
do
with
the
golden
number
getting
too
big
it
won't
go
backwards
either
which
is
pity
because
have
always
wanted
to
know
on
what
day
of
the
week
was
born
nobody
will
tell
me
it
was
one
of
the
lucky
days
am
sure
how
can
find
out
to-morrow
have
just
sent
you
telegram
to
say
that
it
was
sir
richard
tressider's
body
strange
that
you
hadn't
thought
of
him
charles
felt
very
shy
in
the
post
office
yes
about
castle
bumpbrook
she
didn't
believe
there
was
such
place
offered
to
bet
we
went
through
the
telegraph
directory
together
do
you
know
you
come
in
the
castles
not
in
the
bumps
at
all
put
me
among
the
bumps
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
always
thought
castle
was
your
christian
name
kind
of
yes
it
was
sir
richard's
corpse
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
you
will
get
this
letter
day
after
the
telegram
how
did
put
it
body
believed
to
be
that
of
sir
richard
tressider
death
certified
as
by
drowning
inspector
stockley
suspects
foul
play
an
elevenpenny
touch
charles
and
never
signed
it
and
you'll
wonder
what
on
earth
it's
all
about
probably
you
will
dismiss
it
as
joke
and
that
would
be
elevenpence
thrown
away
that
cannot
be
allowed
you
can
get
telegram
repeated
at
half-price
can't
you
think
shall
go
and
have
fivepenny-ha'penny
repeat
say
what
are
you
doing
about
the
weather
are
you
taking
it
lying
down
want
to
sign
petition
or
write
to
my
haven't
got
one
then
shall
write
to
yours
humbly
showing
that
it's
the
rottenest
do
there's
ever
been
do
you
remember
the
story
it
comes
in
gesta
romanorum
or
should
of
the
man
who
built
model
of
another
man
and
threw
things
at
it
and
the
other
man
sat
in
bath
with
mirror
in
his
hand
and
whenever
the
first
man
threw
he
ducked
under
the
water
if
he
got
under
in
time
his
enemy
missed
and
it
was
all
right
otherwise
he
was
killed
well
am
going
to
rig
up
negretti
in
my
room
and
throw
boots
at
it
and
if
the
original
has
to
spend
all
his
time
in
cold
bath
ducking
think
charles
we
shall
get
some
warmer
weather
soon
oh
how
this
spring
of
love
resembleth
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
april
day
charles
in
your
courting
days
was
she
ever
as
cold
to
you
as
this
iv
dear
charles
don't
talk
to
me
about
politics
or
the
weather
or
anything
have
lost
my
tobacco-pouch
oh
charles
what
is
to
be
done
it
is
too
sad
bought
it
in
little
shop
at
ambleside
my
first
my
only
friend
on
the
left-hand
side
as
you
go
down
the
hill
it
was
descended
from
brown
crocodile
in
the
male
line
and
piece
of
indiarubber
in
the
female
at
least
suppose
so
but
the
man
wouldn't
say
for
certain
he
called
it
trade
term
smoked
my
first
pipe
from
it
on
the
top
of
scafell
pike
with
all
england
at
my
feet
the
ups
and
downs
it
has
seen
since
then
the
sweet-smelling
briars
it
has
met
in
sickness
and
in
sorrow
it
comforted
me
in
happiness
it
kept
me
calm
old
age
came
upon
it
slowly
beautifully
in
these
later
years
how
many
men
have
looked
at
it
with
awe
how
many
women
have
insulted
it
and
stitched
its
dear
sides
together
it
passed
away
on
saturday
charles
this
scion
of
the
larger
reptilia
which
sprang
into
being
among
the
mountain-tops
passed
away
in
third-class
carriage
at
dulwich
the
irony
of
it
even
denmark
hill
but
it
matters
not
now
have
lost
it
nor
can
bear
that
another
should
take
its
place
perhaps
in
year
or
two
cannot
say
but
for
the
present
make
shift
with
an
envelope
two
thoughts
sustain
me
first
that
no
strange
eye
will
recognise
it
as
tobacco-pouch
no
strange
hand
therefore
dip
into
it
secondly
that
the
fates
which
have
taken
from
me
my
dearest
possession
must
needs
have
some
great
happiness
in
store
for
me
charles
perceive
you
are
crying
let
us
turn
to
more
cheerful
things
do
you
play
croquet
have
just
joined
croquet
club
don't
know
why
and
one
of
the
rules
is
that
you
have
to
supply
your
own
mallet
how
do
you
do
this
of
course
know
that
ultimately
hand
certain
sum
of
money
to
shopman
and
he
gives
me
very
awkward
parcel
in
exchange
but
what
comes
before
that
have
often
bought
bat
and
though
have
not
yet
selected
one
which
could
make
runs
can
generally
find
something
which
is
pretty
comfortable
to
carry
back
into
the
pavilion
but
have
never
chosen
mallet
what
sort
of
weight
should
it
be
and
is
it
good
thing
to
say
it
doesn't
come
up
very
well
have
they
tell
me
tendency
to
bowness
in
the
legs
and
am
about
million
round
the
biceps
suppose
all
that
is
rather
important
perhaps
they
have
their
mallets
classified
for
different
customers
and
you
have
only
to
describe
yourself
to
them
shall
ask
for
serviceable
mallet
for
blond
serviceable
means
that
if
you
hit
the
ground
very
hard
by
accident
it
doesn't
break
some
of
these
highly
strung
mallets
splinter
up
at
once
you
know
as
matter
of
fact
you
can't
miss
the
ball
at
croquet
can
you
am
thinking
of
golf
what
about
having
splice
with
mine
is
that
done
much
don't
want
to
go
on
to
the
ground
looking
perfect
ass
with
no
splice
when
everybody
else
has
two
or
three
croquet
is
jolly
game
because
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
what
sort
of
collar
you'll
wear
you
just
play
in
your
ordinary
things
all
the
same
shall
have
some
spikes
put
in
my
boots
so
as
not
to
slip
once
took
in
to
dinner
the
sister
of
the
all
england
croquet
champion
did
really
unfortunately
didn't
happen
to
strike
her
subject
and
she
didn't
strike
mine
butterflies
how
bitterly
we
shall
regret
that
evening
which
was
very
jolly
one
all
the
same
here
am
not
knowing
bit
how
to
select
mallet
and
there
possibly
is
she
having
just
found
the
egg
of
the
purple
emperor
labelling
it
in
her
collection
as
that
of
the
camberwell
beauty
let
this
be
lesson
to
all
of
us
charles
feel
very
silly
to-night
must
be
what
they
call
fey
which
is
why
ask
you
how
would
you
like
to
be
pedigree
goat
have
just
seen
in
an
evening
paper
picture
of
mr
brown
with
his
pedigree
goat
somehow
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
goat
could
have
pedigree
but
see
now
that
it
might
be
so
think
if
had
to
be
goat
at
all
should
like
to
be
pedigree
one
in
way
suppose
every
goat
has
pedigree
of
some
kind
but
you
would
need
to
have
pretty
distinguished
one
to
be
spoken
of
as
your
father
charles
would
need
to
have
had
some
renown
among
the
bearded
ones
your
great-uncle
must
have
been
of
the
blood
and
if
this
were
so
should
in
your
place
insist
upon
being
photographed
as
pedigree
goat
with
mr
brown
don't
stand
any
nonsense
about
that
if
ever
have
goat
and
you
won't
let
me
call
it
charles
shall
call
it
david
my
eldest
brother
you
know
was
christened
david
and
called
so
for
year
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
had
boot-and
knife-boy
who
was
unfortunately
named
david
too
say
we
but
was
still
in
the
herebefore
myself
this
led
to
great
confusion
when
the
nurse
called
for
david
to
come
and
take
his
bottle
it
was
very
vexing
to
find
the
other
david
turning
up
with
brown
shoe
in
one
hand
and
fish-knife
in
the
other
something
had
to
be
done
the
baby
was
just
beginning
to
take
notice
the
leather
polisher
had
just
refused
to
in
the
circumstances
the
only
thing
was
to
call
the
baby
by
his
second
name
two
or
three
years
passed
rapidly
and
arrived
just
as
this
happened
the
boot-boy
took
the
last
knife
and
went
now
was
our
chance
my
second
name
had
already
been
fixed
it
was
immediately
decided
that
my
first
should
be
david
the
new
boot-boy
didn't
mind
bit
everybody
else
seemed
delighted
and
then
someone
remembered
that
in
ten
years'
time
should
be
going
to
school
yes
charles
the
initials
you
know
what
boys
are
it
would
have
been
very
awkward
and
so
now
you
see
why
am
going
to
call
my
pedigree
goat
david
dear
charles
am
learning
to
dance
the
minuet
say
the
instead
of
because
am
sure
mine
is
very
particular
kind
of
one
you
start
off
with
three
slides
to
the
left
then
three
to
the
right
and
then
you
stop
and
waggle
the
left
leg
after
that
you
bow
to
your
partner
in
acknowledgement
of
the
interest
she
has
taken
in
it
all
and
that
ends
the
first
figure
there
are
lots
more
but
one
figure
at
time
is
my
motto
at
present
slide
well
but
am
moderate
waggler
why
am
doing
this
you
ask
my
dear
charles
you
never
know
when
little
thing
like
minuet
will
turn
out
useful
the
time
may
well
come
when
you
will
say
to
yourself
ah
if
only
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
learning
that
when
was
young
how
etc
there
were
once
two
men
who
were
cast
ashore
on
desert
island
one
of
them
had
an
axe
and
bag
of
nails
and
goat
and
box
of
matches
and
barrel
of
gunpowder
and
keg
of
biscuits
and
tarpaulin
and
some
fish-hooks
the
other
could
only
dance
the
minuet
years
rolled
by
and
one
day
ship
put
in
at
that
island
for
water
as
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
water
there
but
they
found
two
skeletons
which
shows
that
in
certain
circumstances
proficiency
in
the
minuet
is
as
valuable
as
an
axe
and
bag
of
nails
and
goat
and
box
of
matches
and
all
the
other
things
that
mentioned
just
now
so
am
learning
in
case
my
niece
aged
twenty
months
do
bore
you
has
made
her
first
joke
let
it
be
put
on
record
and
handed
down
to
those
that
come
after
she
walked
into
the
study
where
her
father
was
reading
and
her
mother
writing
they
agreed
not
to
take
any
notice
of
her
in
order
to
see
what
would
happen
she
marched
up
to
her
father
stroked
his
face
and
said
hallo
daddy
no
answer
she
gazed
round
and
then
went
over
to
the
writing-desk
hallo
mummy
dead
silence
she
stood
for
moment
looking
rather
puzzled
at
last
she
went
back
to
her
father
bent
down
and
patted
his
slippers
and
said
hallo
boots
then
she
walked
quite
happily
out
of
the
room
however
we
won't
bother
about
her
because
have
something
much
more
exciting
to
tell
you
m'gubbin
has
signed
on
for
the
something
rovers
for
next
season
saw
it
in
the
paper
it
had
little
paragraph
all
to
itself
this
is
splendid
news
haven't
been
so
happy
about
anything
for
long
time
whaur's
your
wully
gaukrodger
now
let
us
arrange
pentathlon
for
them
i'll
back
m'g
and
you
can
hold
the
towel
for
gauk
my
man
would
win
at
football
of
course
and
yours
at
cricket
but
the
other
three
events
would
be
exciting
chess
golf
and
the
minuet
think
can
see
m'gubbin
sliding
one
two
three
one
two
three
there
now
he's
waggling
his
left
leg
charles
you're
goner
hand
over
the
stakes
look
here
smoke
too
much
at
least
have
been
lately
let's
give
it
up
charles
i'll
give
it
up
altogether
for
week
if
you
will
did
you
know
that
you
can
allay
the
craving
for
tobacco
by
the
judicious
use
of
bull's-eyes
allay
is
the
word
you
carry
bag
of
bull's-eyes
with
you
swear
this
is
true
saw
it
in
the
press
and
whenever
you
feel
desire
to
smoke
you
just
pop
bull's-eye
in
your
mouth
in
little
while
they
say
your
taste
for
tobacco
and
imagine
for
everything
else
is
quite
gone
this
ought
to
be
more
widely
known
and
then
your
host
would
say
try
one
of
these
bull's-eyes
won't
you
import
them
direct
and
you
would
reply
thanks
very
much
but
would
rather
have
one
of
my
own
if
may
have
bull's-eye
if
you
like
your
partner
would
say
at
dance
of
course
too
they
would
have
special
bull's-eye
compartments
in
trains
that
would
be
jolly
but
it
would
ruin
the
stage
the
hero
who
always
lights
cigarette
before
giving
off
his
best
epigram
don't
know
what
he'd
do
you
see
he
couldn't
well
he'd
have
to
wait
such
time
why
are
they
called
bull's-eyes
don't
believe
i've
ever
seen
bull's-eye
really
close
if
you
look
bull
in
the
eye
he
doesn't
go
for
you
which
eye
he
might
be
left-handed
bull
you'd
look
at
the
wrong
eye
then
where
would
you
be
the
world
is
too
much
with
me
charles
but
all
the
same
i've
just
ordered
flannel
suit
which
will
make
castle
bumpbrook
stare
sort
of
purplish
and
it
makes
up
very
smart
and
they
can
do
me
two
pairs
of
trousers
in
it
whatever
that
means
should
have
thought
they
could
have
done
me
as
many
pairs
as
liked
to
ask
for
but
it
seems
not
they
only
print
limited
edition
and
then
destroy
the
original
plates
so
that
nobody
else
can
walk
about
looking
like
me
asked
the
man
if
he
thought
it
would
play
croquet
well
and
he
said
yes
by
the
way
have
learnt
some
more
about
croquet
since
wrote
last
first
then
you
can
go
round
in
one
if
you're
frightfully
good
should
like
to
go
round
in
one
suppose
that
would
be
the
record
secondly
if
you're
wired
from
all
the
balls
so
that
you
can't
get
clear
shot
at
every
part
of
any
one
of
them
you
go
into
baulk
and
have
another
turn
this
must
happen
pretty
often
because
you
could
never
have
clear
shot
at
the
back
of
ball
unless
you
went
right
round
the
world
the
other
way
and
that
would
be
too
risky
besides
wasting
so
much
time
no
can
see
there's
lot
to
learn
in
the
game
but
patience
charles
patience
shall
go
round
in
one
yet
vi
dear
charles
are
you
coming
up
to
town
this
month
if
you
do
we
will
make
journey
into
shepherd's
bush
together
and
see
the
exhibition
am
afraid
have
been
doing
shepherd's
bush
an
injustice
all
these
years
john
and
once
arranged
system
of
seven
hells
in
which
we
put
all
the
men
we
hated
nobody
known
personally
to
either
of
us
was
eligible
so
your
name
never
came
up
dear
charles
which
meant
that
they
had
to
be
filled
with
people
in
the
public
eye
the
seventh
division
contained
two
only
one
socialist
who
is
thought
good
deal
of
by
himself
mean
the
other
novelist
who
only
writes
about
superior
people
who
drop
their
g's
the
punishment
for
this
class
was
simple
perpetual
life
in
an
open
boat
on
choppy
sea
smoking
virginian
cigarettes
john's
idea
chiefly
he
being
bad
sailor
the
doom
decreed
for
the
unfortunates
in
the
fifth
class
now
am
coming
to
the
point
of
this
reminiscence
was
more
subtle
they
had
to
live
at
shepherd's
bush
and
go
to
musical
comedy
every
afternoon
there
were
four
men
in
the
fifth
class
three
of
them
we
need
not
bother
about
but
the
latest
arrival
was
certain
cleric
who
advertised
good
deal
one
day
we
met
somebody
who
knew
him
well
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
him
gently
and
he
was
much
distressed
about
it
he
asked
if
there
was
any
hope
we
replied
that
if
his
friend
turned
over
new
leaf
and
kept
his
name
out
of
the
papers
for
bit
he
might
in
time
be
promoted
into
the
fourth
division
where
every
day
you
watched
sussex
play
essex
at
leyton
and
had
mutton
sandwiches
for
lunch
he
was
so
glad
to
hear
this
that
he
made
us
promise
to
let
him
know
when
any
such
step
was
meditated
accordingly
after
month
of
perfect
quiet
on
the
part
of
the
reverend
gentleman
we
sent
his
friend
telegram
bernard
left
shepherd's
bush
by
the
nine
o'clock
steamer
this
morning
and
now
it
looks
as
if
the
bush
were
much
more
of
place
than
we
thought
every
week
or
so
have
an
inspiration
and
had
one
yesterday
when
the
thought
struck
me
suddenly
that
it
would
be
good
idea
to
buy
some
postcards
you
get
them
at
the
post
office
six
stout
ones
for
ninepence
oh
no
that
can't
be
right
nine
stout
ones
for
sixpence
shouldn't
think
postcard
would
ever
get
too
stout
not
unpleasantly
so
mean
you
hardly
ever
see
an
obese
postcard
don't
believe
have
used
one
of
any
dimensions
for
ten
years
yet
they
are
such
handy
things
when
you
want
to
say
right
or
don't
quite
know
whether
you
are
very
truly
or
sincerely
the
postcard
touch
is
hereditary
some
families
have
it
ours
hasn't
but
now
it
is
going
to
begin
tomorrow
buy
as
many
stout
ones
for
sixpence
as
they
will
give
me
talking
of
buying
croquet
mallets
and
things
went
into
little
tobacconist's
little
while
ago
what
for
guess
and
while
was
there
man
came
in
and
ordered
pipe
two
ounces
of
bird's-eye
and
box
of
matches
wanted
to
tell
him
that
you
really
required
rubber
pouch
as
well
and
little
silver
thing
for
pressing
down
the
tobacco
it
must
want
some
nerve
to
start
straight
off
like
that
especially
at
his
age
forty
or
so
am
about
to
play
golf
seriously
and
shall
certainly
get
my
clubs
at
different
shops
driver
at
the
stores
putter
in
piccadilly
niblick
what's
niblick
anyhow
shall
have
several
of
them
because
of
the
name
and
several
niblicks
in
fleet
street
it
would
be
too
absurd
to
buy
dozen
assorted
clubs
one
ball
jersey
and
little
red
flag
all
at
the
same
place
yes
should
love
to
come
down
and
play
cricket
for
castle
bumpbrook
and
many
thanks
for
asking
me
don't
make
runs
nowadays
charles
but
if
you
feel
that
the
mere
presence
of
gentleman
from
lunnon
would
inspire
and
as
it
were
give
tone
to
the
side
then
am
at
your
service
you
do
say
lunnon
in
the
country
don't
you
when
you
mean
london
and
you
say
bain't
too
how
jolly
bain't
bowler
zur
and
you
pronounce
the
b-o
as
if
it
were
curtsey
and
not
cravat
put
oi
it's
no
good
can't
keep
it
up
put
me
in
last
and
i'll
make
not
out
and
that
will
bring
me
top
of
the
averages
if
you
divide
by
you
get
an
awful
lot
you
know
you
have
an
average
bat
suppose
like
them
rather
light
or
would
take
the
money
whichever
would
be
more
convenient
have
just
written
myself
letter
pleasantly
standoffish
but
not
haughty
the
reason
is
that
have
my
doubts
about
the
post
office
so
am
giving
them
test
my
address
as
you
have
discovered
is
an
awkward
one
there
are
nine
distinct
ways
of
getting
it
wrong
and
most
people
try
two
or
three
of
them
but
the
letters
do
get
here
eventually
after
expect
good
deal
of
sickness
on
the
part
of
the
postman
what
am
beginning
to
wonder
now
is
whether
letter
with
the
right
address
would
arrive
fancy
that
the
chief
of
the
detective
department
would
suspect
trap
and
send
it
somewhere
else
and
as
am
certain
that
have
never
received
one
or
two
letters
which
ought
to
have
had
am
writing
to
myself
to
see
it
is
great
art
that
of
writing
nicely
to
yourself
to
say
enough
yet
not
too
much
when
john
was
getting
engaged
he
wrote
to
himself
every
day
before
he
started
doing
this
he
used
to
spend
hours
sitting
and
wondering
whether
the
postman
had
been
the
few
letters
he
had
had
from
her
came
by
the
eight-thirty
post
at
eight-fifteen
he
began
to
look
out
nothing
happened
an
awful
quarter
of
an
hour
followed
eight-thirty
no
postman's
knock
never
mind
perhaps
he's
late
eight-thirty
five
well
it
is
rather
busy
time
besides
he
may
have
fallen
down
eight-forty
one
ray
of
light
left
he
did
come
once
you
remember
at
eight-forty
two
eight-forty
five
despair
half-an
hour's
agony
you
observe
charles
then
he
thought
of
writing
to
himself
in
time
for
that
delivery
the
result
was
that
he
remained
quite
calm
knowing
that
the
postman
was
bound
to
come
ah
there
he
is
will
there
be
letter
from
her
yes
no
you
see
your
heart
in
your
mouth
for
five
seconds
only
never
saw
any
of
these
letters
but
should
say
that
at
the
beginning
they
were
sympathetic
buck
up
it's
all
right
or
hopeful
never
mind
she'll
write
to-morrow
later
on
they
would
become
cynical
done
in
the
eye
again
what
on
earth
do
you
expect
and
finally
expect
insulting
you
silly
ass
chuck
it
then
of
course
she
wrote
good-bye
don't
forget
am
going
to
play
for
you
would
it
be
side
to
wear
flannels
white
boots
would
be
bit
lofty
anyhow
then
shall
wear
one
brown
pad
on
the
right
leg
vii
dear
charles
many
thanks
for
your
letter
don't
side
just
because
you
get
up
at
six
o'clock
and
feed
the
cow
or
shave
the
goat
or
whatever
it
is
other
people
get
up
early
too
for
the
last
few
weeks
have
sprung
out
of
bed
at
seven-thirty
always
spring
out
it
is
so
much
more
classy
but
doubt
if
can
keep
it
up
the
truth
is
that
have
just
made
an
unhappy
discovery
was
under
the
impression
that
my
man's
name
was
turley
should
say
my
third
of
man
because
share
with
him
two
others
but
anyhow
thought
his
whole
name
was
turley
so
used
to
write
nice
little
notes
beginning
if
you're
waking
call
me
turley
and
leave
them
about
for
him
he
invariably
woke
at
seven
and
read
them
and
came
and
called
me
mother
dear
of
course
had
to
get
up
well
have
now
heard
that
his
name
is
really
holland
which
makes
all
the
difference
it
would
be
absurd
to
write
him
any
more
notes
of
that
kind
my
one
satisfaction
is
that
can
claim
to
own
third
of
holland
which
is
about
square
miles
multiply
that
by
and
you
get
it
in
acres
altogether
the
landowner
moreover
charles
my
lad
you
are
not
the
one
person
who
knows
things
about
animals
you
may
be
on
terms
of
familiarity
with
the
cow
and
the
goat
but
these
are
not
the
only
beasts
what
acquaintance
for
example
have
you
with
reptiles
the
common
newt
do
you
know
anything
about
him
no
well
then
now
i'll
tell
you
when
was
seven
and
john
was
eight
we
went
to
naturalist's
in
hampstead
to
inquire
the
price
of
newts
they
were
threepence
each
not
being
quite
in
season
we
bought
sixpennyworth
the
man
put
them
into
paper
bag
for
us
and
we
took
them
up
on
the
heath
to
give
them
gallop
when
we
opened
the
bag
we
found
three
newts
inside
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
thing
could
have
happened
naturally
so
we
went
back
to
the
shop
to
explain
to
the
man
that
he
had
made
mistake
however
he
hadn't
he
had
merely
given
us
one
newt
discount
remember
that
when
next
you're
buying
them
well
we
returned
to
the
heath
and
they
showed
their
paces
now
the
newt
is
an
amphibious
animal
greek
he
is
as
much
at
ease
in
the
bathroom
as
on
the
mat
so
when
we
got
them
home
we
arranged
to
try
them
in
our
bath
this
is
where
you
cry
for
time
all
went
well
they
dived
swam
back
and
front
trod
water
returned
to
life
when
apparently
drowned
and
so
forth
then
john
pulled
up
the
waste-pipe
he
says
now
that
he
did
it
inadvertently
but
fancy
that
he
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
what
did
happen
was
that
they
got
into
the
whirlpool
and
disappeared
we
turned
on
both
the
hot
and
cold
taps
to
see
if
they
would
come
back
but
they
didn't
apparently
you
don't
we
rushed
into
the
garden
to
see
if
they
would
return
by
the
drain-pipe
with
the
rainwater
but
not
they
only
the
paper
bag
was
left
to
us
and
to
this
day
cannot
recall
it
without
tear
it
was
john
who
popped
it
charles
we
never
saw
those
newts
again
crusoe
cleaver
and
robinson
were
their
names
robinson
and
crusoe
they
were
to
have
been
and
when
the
third
came
and
seemed
to
take
fancy
to
robinson
we
called
him
cleaver
where
are
they
now
in
the
mighty
thames
somewhere
suppose
so
charles
if
ever
you
are
near
the
river
keep
friendly
eye
open
for
them
will
you
they
may
be
little
wild
now
but
they
were
good
newts
in
their
day
we
had
buforium
too
in
our
time
you
must
know
have
just
made
that
word
up
and
it
means
place
where
you
keep
toads
in
our
case
it
was
the
sink
the
toad
as
you
may
not
have
realised
has
no
vomerine
or
maxillary
teeth
but
he
has
got
distinct
tympanum
however
what
really
wanted
to
say
was
that
the
toad
has
pyriform
tongue
of
incredible
length
by
means
of
which
he
catches
his
prey
thus
differing
from
the
frog
which
leaps
at
em
we
used
to
station
toad
opposite
one
of
the
walls
of
the
sink
of
the
buforium
and
then
run
his
breakfast
down
the
side
sometimes
it
would
be
very
long
centipede
and
then
you
could
have
one
toad
for
each
end
or
what
brutes
little
boys
are
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
any
more
about
toads
except
to
say
that
his
omosternum
is
generally
missing
that
must
be
very
annoying
did
ever
talk
to
you
about
hedgehogs
we
kept
no
end
of
them
but
peter
was
the
only
one
who
stayed
he
used
to
live
in
the
scullery
so
as
to
see
that
no
black-beetles
got
about
one
night
the
cook
woke
up
suddenly
and
remembered
that
she
had
left
the
scullery
tap
running
so
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
downstairs
not
even
stopping
to
put
on
slippers
she
was
very
heavy
woman
no
peter
wasn't
hurt
much
but
she
refused
to
have
him
in
the
kitchen
again
this
is
very
zoological
letter
but
just
wanted
to
show
you
that
you
weren't
the
only
one
time
fails
me
to
tell
you
of
mole
which
we
put
in
the
geranium-bed
of
certain
kind
of
caterpillar
from
which
we
caught
nettlerash
of
particularly
handsome
triton
which
we
kept
in
tank
with
crab
giving
them
fresh
and
salt
water
on
alternative
days
so
that
there
should
be
no
quarrelling
it
is
enough
if
have
made
it
clear
that
one
does
not
need
to
have
castle
bumpbrook
on
one's
notepaper
in
order
to
commune
with
nature
want
two
wedding
presents
don't
mean
for
myself
what
do
you
suggest
bar
anything
for
the
table
newly
married
couples
might
do
nothing
but
eat
to
judge
from
the
things
they
get
given
them
at
present
hesitate
between
the
useful
as
for
instance
twenty
thousand
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
the
purely
ornamental
say
an
antimacassar
mr
and
mrs
samuel
jones
towel-horse
you
never
see
that
do
you
and
yet
you
could
pay
anything
for
pure-bred
one
and
they
are
very
useful
the
bride
always
wears
valuable
old
honiton
lace
the
gift
of
her
aunt
otherwise
it's
not
legal
kitty
never
had
an
aunt
had
she
then
you
aren't
properly
married
charles
i'm
sorry
viii
dear
charles
thing
has
just
happened
to
me
which
really
only
happens
to
people
in
jokes
you
would
not
believe
it
did
not
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
the
heart
isn't
on
the
left
side
as
you
thought
by
the
way
it's
bang
in
the
middle
only
the
left
auricle
does
all
the
work
however
on
my
heart
and
swear
that
it
is
true
was
in
the
silver
department
of
liberty's
buying
some
spoons
yes
fell
back
on
spoons
after
all
never
fall
back
on
spoon
charles
if
you
can
help
it
it
was
hot
day
and
the
business
of
selection
was
so
exhausting
that
took
off
my
hat
and
gloves
and
laid
them
on
chair
beside
me
when
it
was
all
over
the
man
went
off
to
make
out
the
bill
wandered
round
the
place
looking
at
all
the
other
things
which
wished
had
bought
instead
suddenly
voice
at
my
side
said
can
you
tell
me
if
this
is
where
you
get
ladies'
jerseys
for
golf
told
you
you
had
to
get
jersey
for
golf
said
oh
do
you
think
that
is
good
thing
rather
thought
of
spoons
myself
mean
for
wedding
present
one
does
want
something
which
oh
beg
your
pardon
yes
am
mr
liberty
no
liberty
at
all
madam
assure
you
this
is
the
silver
department
you
know
yes
all
that
white
shiny
stuff
well
daresay
we
could
do
you
one
if
you
wouldn't
mind
having
the
lion
worked
on
it
no
we
don't
charge
for
the
lion
or
what
about
something
quite
simple
in
pewter
oh
see
the
art
muslin
department
would
be
the
nearest
thing
we
have
freer
swing
certainly
good-morning
well
no
didn't
say
that
exactly
having
my
hand
on
the
left
side
of
my
heart
it
would
be
impossible
to
pretend
that
did
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
how
easy
it
is
lucy
to
slip
from
the
rocky
path
of
truth
into
the
crevasse
of
make-believe
maxim
from
the
fairchild
family
but
really
and
really
charles
she
did
take
me
for
the
shopwalker
in
the
silver
department
and
she
did
ask
for
ladies'
golf
jerseys
what
actually
said
was
i'm
very
sorry
but
i'm
afraid
i'm
only
customer
and
she
said
oh
i'm
so
sorry
and
then
put
on
my
hat
to
show
that
had
one
and
took
it
off
again
to
show
that
knew
my
manners
and
she
went
off
to
the
clock
counter
and
said
she
was
sorry
to
trouble
the
man
behind
it
but
could
he
tell
her
where
she
went
for
ladies'
jerseys
for
golf
and
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
they
didn't
sell
them
but
would
she
like
some
clocks
on
her
stockings
instead
altogether
there
was
good
deal
of
sorrow
going
about
but
not
on
my
part
never
in
common
tweeds
to
be
mistaken
for
one
of
those
splendid
frock-coated
gentleman
and
admitted
into
lady's
confidence
on
question
of
jerseys
there
was
glory
for
you
doubt
now
if
ought
to
have
gone
down
to
castle
bumpbrook
anyhow
should
have
insisted
on
all
the
gate
what
was
the
gate
distinctly
saw
three
small
boys
hiding
behind
cow
suppose
they
paid
all
right
charles
did
enjoy
it
awfully
as
think
have
told
you
several
times
it
was
good
of
you
to
send
me
in
first
with
the
postman
and
as
post-man
am
sure
should
love
him
very
much
but
he
is
too
fast
for
me
on
the
cricket-field
there
wasn't
run
there
you
know
simple
shot
straight
to
cover
expect
he
thought
it
was
an
express
delivery
or
late
fee
stroke
with
immediate
in
the
top
left-hand
corner
or
perhaps
the
brown
pad
made
him
think
was
telegram
if
ever
go
in
first
with
him
again
shall
register
myself
gather
that
the
vicar
has
to
bowl
at
one
end
all
the
time
hasn't
he
in
lieu
of
tithes
or
something
otherwise
you
get
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
down
on
you
he
varies
his
pitch
cleverly
admit
his
firstly
would
take
any
batsman
by
surprise
can't
think
why
it
only
bounces
once
finger-spin
suppose
then
immediately
afterwards
you
get
his
secondly
high
full
pitch
which
would
almost
be
wide
in
layman
yet
all
the
time
you
feel
that
he
is
only
leading
up
to
his
sixthly
and
lastly
my
brethren
which
is
one
of
the
subtlest
half-volleys
have
ever
seen
charles
love
your
garden
it
was
jolly
to
see
the
white
flower
of
mrs
sinkins'
blameless
life
again
knew
mrs
sinkins
as
bulb
mean
as
boy
and
have
always
regarded
her
with
affection
suppose
shall
have
to
wait
for
dorothy
perkins
she
is
hardly
out
yet
my
love
is
like
oh
but
dorothy
is
pink
anyhow
she
sweetly
smiles
in
june
and
it's
just
on
june
so
i'm
blowed
if
don't
come
down
to
see
her
next
month
whether
you
ask
me
or
not
better
send
me
an
invitation
for
form's
sake
and
teach
me
about
flowers
will
you
and
will
tell
you
about
motor
omnibuses
why
do
they
all
end
in
kins
it
can't
be
coincidence
that
the
only
two
which
know
to
talk
to
should
do
this
funnily
enough
motor
omnibuses
all
end
in
putney
which
shows
that
this
is
very
small
world
after
all
and
we
needs
must
love
the
highest
when
we
see
it
so
near
and
yet
so
far
doesn't
it
annoy
you
when
you
meet
person
in
london
whom
you
last
saw
in
uganda
and
he
fatuously
observes
that
the
world
is
very
small
place
it
would
have
been
much
smaller
place
prima
facie
if
you
had
last
seen
him
at
leamington
to
return
to
dorothy
we
have
flowers
in
london
too
what
about
the
temple
show
saw
man
there
with
kodak
suppose
he
wanted
to
snap
the
roses
as
they
were
growing
that's
the
sort
of
weather
we
are
on
the
embankment
oh
but
the
fruit
there
wish
were
prize
tomato
what
complexion
